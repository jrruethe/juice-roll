Introduction
Juice is an oracle I have been iterating on for a long time. It is intended to be travel friendly and minimal,
yet versatile and complete. It is a dense collection of generic tables from various sources that can be used
to enhance your roleplaying experience. There is a large focus on immersion and NPC interaction, because
I find that this is where I get the most enjoyment out of a solo session.

If you are familiar with the Mythic system, this oracle will be easy to use. It provides alternative variations of
the major Mythic components, such as:

- Fate Check
- Meaning Tables
- Random Events
- Scenes and Transitions

With this oracle and a few index cards for keeping track of threads and characters, you will be all set to
go! Either way, I highly recommend reading Mythic GME 2e.

This was written specifically with D&D 5e and Ironsworn in mind. That said, it is relatively system agnostic,
although setting-wise it favors fantasy.

Something to keep in mind: Every piece of this is optional. You can use it exclusively, use it to supplement
your other tables, or replace pieces of it with your own tables.

Preparation

Printing
Every printer is different, and some have tighter tolerances on the margins than others. I have access to a
printer at my office, and two different printers at my local library. Based on the testing I have done, I need
different settings for all three of them.

The office printer is able to print really close to the paper edges. I can use “fit to page” and it just works.
One of the library printers needs me to scale to 98% to not have things cut off of the edges and bottom,
while the other needs 96% for some reason. In both cases, the output margin is still large enough that it
messes up the folding, so I need to cut off some of the edge.

And therefore, my advice is to first try printing at 98% and step down to 97%, then 96%, if words on the
sides or bottom are cut off.

It should print centered by default, but if you have a setting, make sure the page is vertically and
horizontally centered.

Finally, you want to print in landscape, double sided, and flip on the SHORT side. If you instead flip on the
long side, then the back will be upside down.

The edges should be about 1/8 of an inch wide, any larger and you will want to cut some off.




                                                      2
                     > 1/4 Inch, too wide




Closer to 1/8 Inch, this is good. Even smaller would be better.




                              3
Folding
To fold it, first place it on the table in front of you such that “Meaning Tables / Name Generator” is
readable in the lower left. Then, pick up the right edge and flip it over to the left. You should see the
“Extended NPC Converstation Tables” readable on the left side.




Next, take the top edge and fold it down to the bottom edge. You will be able to see the “Wilderness”
table readable on the left.




Then, take the left edge and fold it all the way to the right to make a crease down the center. You will see
“Details” readable on the left, and “Fate Check” readable on the right.




                                                     4
Unfold that last one, then fold the left edge to the center crease. You will have 3 panes: “Fate Check”,
“Object / Treasure”, and “Dungeon Generator”.




Fold the right edge over to the center crease. Now you will see “Fate Check” on the left, and “Meaning
Tables / Name Generator” on the right.




                                                   5
Fold the center crease again, closing it like a book. You will see “Details” on the front, and flipping it over
you will see “Quest” on the back.




Finally, open the book, then open the left and right flaps so you have four panels wide again. You are
going to use a scissors to cut down the middle crease, but only for the top layer (don’t cut the bottom
layer!). If done correctly, you will be able to flip the right side up and see the “Abstract Icons”.




                                                      6
Fold it back down into the little book again. You are done! A later section will show you all the ways you
can open this to access the tables you need.




                                                    7
Requirements
So what do you need to use Juice?

Way back, Juice was designed to be used alongside Ironsworn. As such, I have done my best to stick to the
same dice that Ironsworn uses, by only adding the Fate Dice.

- 2 Fate Dice, different colors
- 1d6 (Preferably the same color as one of the Fate Dice, to help you remember which one is “primary”)
- 1d100 / 1d% / 2d10 for table lookups
- A few index cards for tracking lists

While a d20 is not required, it can certainly be handy. The “Discover Meaning” tables and the “Name
Generator” tables are the only two tables that have 20 entries. They are both split in half though, so you
can roll 1d10 on either half. Sometimes I just roll 1d100 and if the first number is odd, use the second
number to index into the top half (even -> bottom half). 3d20 makes it easy to generate names quickly.

Yes, the Fate Dice can be a problem. They aren’t as common, and most people who play D&D 5e probably
don’t have a set. Fear not, there are some ways around this.


The TOFU Method

There is a PWYW oracle called “Tiny Oracle with Funny Dice”, or TOFU.

https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/381660/tofu-tiny-oracle-with-funny-dice

The author describes how to take standard d6 dice with pips (dots, not numbers) and connect the pips to
turn them into Fate dice:




                                                    8
The d6 Method

Similar to the above, but just memorize that:

- 1,2: Minus
- 3,4: Blank
- 5,6: Plus


The Table Method

If all else fails, you can use a d10 and just do a table lookup. The probabilities change slightly, and you will
get more random events, but it works in a pinch. If you are doing this, you can also roll with advantage on
the normal column to get “likely” results.


The Phone App Method

Maybe this is obvious, but a phone app can roll the dice for you. I like the Android app named “Dice” by
“7Pixels”: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.sevenpixels.dice

It rolls them in 3D with the tap of the screen, which is important since the position of the dice can matter
(more on that later…).




                                                       9
Using
Juice can be used with your system of choice, or it can be used standalone.



Ironsworn
Ironsworn is already completely standalone, and since a lot of Juice was inspired by Ironsworn, you don’t
really need Juice to play it.

That said, I never particularly liked the “Ask the Oracle” move, that table was way too hard to memorize. So
my recommendation would be to just replace that move with Juice’s Fate Check and use Ironsworn for
everything else. (In fact, that is how this whole project started!)

The rest of Juice is essentially for inspiration.

If you are looking for something more compact, then I can highly recommend Winsome: https://
elstiko.itch.io/winsome

This is a miniature Ironsworn in pocketfold format, which you can pair up with Juice to cover your ruleset
and oracles. This is perfect for those wanting a portable travel setup.



Ironsworn Mini
As awesome as Winsome is, I didn’t particularly like the terminology changes. It made it difficult for me to
map things back to my understanding of Ironsworn. So I translated it:

Create your Character

Envision your character's role in the world, then write their name & title on your sheet, like "Anika, Huntress
of the Briar", or "Tenzar, Space Marine of the Chaosphere". Your title should imply the sorts of skills you
might have, like hunting or shooting, etc.


Stats

Assign the numbers 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 to these stats of interacting with the world. The higher the number, the
better your character usually is at that method.

- Edge: When you are quick, precise, or nimble
- Heart: When you are honest, honorable, or trusting
- Iron: When you are strong, imposing, or brutal
- Shadow: When you are silent, secretive, or deceptive
- Wits: When you are wise, learned, or alert


                                                      10
Resources

- Momentum: (your ability to stay proactive) starts at 2, its maximum is 10.
- Supply: (the things you own) starts at its maximum of 5.
- Spirit: (how good you feel) starts at its maximum of 5.
- Health: (how much you thrive) starts at its maximum of 5.

When you have lost all of either spirit or health, you are either too sad, or too dead, to continue.
When you need to reduce a certain track, but it's at zero, reduce one of your other tracks instead.


Story

- Experience: (the marks of wisdom and skill gained through adventure) starts at 0, its maximum is 10
- Friendships: (the bonds between you and other important figures) starts at 0, its maximum is 10


Resolve Risk

When you take an action involving a risk of failure, envision the success you hope for, the complication you
fear a little, and the failure you fear the most.

Roll a six-sided die for your action die, adding your stat to the result. If any skills inferred by your titles
apply to this action, also add +1 per relevant title. Roll two ten-sided dice for your challenge dice.

If your action die is...

- Higher than both challenge dice, you succeed completely. Take +1 to two tracks, or +2 to one track, to
show how your character's situation improves with this strong result.
- Only higher than one challenge die, your success is complicated.
You can reduce one track by 1 and increase another by 1 if it helps you tell the story of this mixed result.
- Equal to, or lower than, both challenge dice, the failure you fear the most occurs. Suffer -1 from two
tracks, or -2 from one track, to show how your character's situation worsens.

If your momentum is higher than one or both challenge dice, you may choose to spend it all to beat one
or both challenge dice, respectively. Reset your momentum to its starting value, add any new momentum
you gain from the new outcome, & enjoy the upgraded outcome of your action!

Imagine Life

Describe the places you explore, as well as who & what you discover or encounter on your hero's journey.
Envision your fluctuating tracks as actual gains or losses to your equipment, your state of mind & being.
Make vows, to yourself & others, then set out to achieve them.

> If you're playing alongside friends as allies, everyone shares one supply value, & everyone gains
experience when completing collaborative vows.

Progress Tracks

Any task/journey/battle or vow which can't be resolved in a single action requires progress on a track of
ten spaces. Find an empty track on the back of this sheet (or draw your own), name the task, then envision
the difficulty:

- Troublesome (1 experience): Mark 4 spaces per success.
- Dangerous (2 experience): Mark 3 spaces per success.
- Formidable (3 experience): Mark 2 spaces per success.
- Extreme (4 experience): Mark 1 space per success.

When you complete a track, gain the related experience. When your experience track is full, you can erase
it all to add another title based on your greatest achievement during that time.

Your story begins with two vows: the first vow is Formidable or Extreme, made to yourself. The second is
Troublesome or Dangerous, made to someone else. Envision the moment you made the second vow, &
play from there.


Friendship Changes You

When you form a valuable friendship, it influences you even when they are absent or deceased, mark 1
progress on the friendships track. When this track is full, you have too many valuable memories to risk
further adventures. It's time for a new character's story.

—

In other words, all the mechanics are boiled down to the Resolve Risk move, which will increase and


                                                   12
decrease your resources. All the narrative is boiled down to the Imagine Life move (this is where Juice can
help). Completing Progress Tracks adds to your Experience Track. Completing the Experience Track adds
to your Titles, which essentially increases your Stats. The narrative will increase your Friendship Track, and
when that is completed your adventure concludes.



D&D 5e
Soloing 5e isn’t that much different than soloing any other system. The Challenge procedure detailed later
in this document is designed to replace the need for a DM to generate DCs and call for checks. D&D 5e
Combat has enough rules that all you really need is the NPC Combat table to add a little variety to their
tactics.

The general advice is to rely on your system rules as much as you can. Do Skill Checks instead of Fate
Checks whenever possible. If you pass your Skill Check, THEN you can Fate Check to learn the answer.

For example, instead of asking “Is there a monster hiding in that cave?”, do a Perception Check. If you
pass, then do the Fate Check to determine if the monster exists, and your character learns that information.
If you fail, don’t do the Fate Check; neither you nor your character know the answer, and perhaps you will
find out later.




Aside from that, the rest of the tables in Juice, combined with the procedures discussed later in this
document, will take care of replacing the DM for your game.

I HIGHLY recommend reading “DM Yourself” (and its sequel “DM Yourselves”) by Tom Scutt if you are
going to be soloing 5e regularly. It is full of advice and procedures to follow, specifically for 5e.




                                                     13
Ironsworn + D&D 5e
I love Ironsworn, but I also have a lot of D&D 5e material. I like the mechanical crunch of D&D 5e, but I like
the narrative storytelling style of Ironsworn.

Why not do both?

Surprisingly, they can be combined rather elegantly. Ironsworn modifiers go from 1 to 5, and D&D 5e
modifiers go from 1 to 10 for all except the highest levels, so we can double the Ironsworn dice to work
with D&D 5e.

Normally in D&D 5e, you roll 1d20, add your modifier / proficiency bonus, and try to beat the DC. Instead,
we are going to roll 1d12, add your modifier / proficiency bonus, and compare it against the 2d20
challenge dice. If you beat both, it is a Strong Hit. If you beat one, it is a Weak Hit, and if you beat neither it
is a Miss. Strong Hit with a Match (both d20s are the same) is a Critical Success, and Miss with a Match is a
Critical Fail.

Advantage / Disadvantage is just rolling 2d12 and taking the higher or lower.

Everything else is the same! You can use your existing 5e character sheet with no real modifications, you
never need to generate a DC, and you get partial successes for free!

Use D&D 5e rules for Skill Checks and Combat, and use Ironsworn Moves for non-combat / narrative.
When using Ironsworn Moves, you can map stats like Edge / Iron to DEX / CON, etc. Sometimes an
Ironsworn stat maps to two D&D 5e stats, and you can just choose what fits best for that situation.

You also get a momentum track, and it is doubled (goes up to 20). I use a d20 as a tracker for it. Progress
moves are unchanged, and you can use progress tracks as normal. Keep track of Ironsworn Experience
separately; I recommend using the “Title” simplification discussed in the “Ironsworn Mini” above, where you
can spend Ironsworn Experience to grant yourself a new Title. If your Title can be applied to a roll, you get
Advantage.

For resource tracks, the Health of Ironsworn are replaced by your D&D 5e Character Sheet’s HP. If I need
to add or reduce HP, I roll the character’s Hit Die and add or subtract that value. D&D 5e doesn’t have
“Stress”, so you can add a Stress tracker to your character sheet. For supplies, I usually map this to basic
items in my inventory, such as rations, water, torches, rope, etc.

Don’t use Assets; your D&D 5e Character Sheet has Class Abilities and Feats instead.

Finally, use Milestone Leveling and let the narrative guide when you should level up.

Caveats:

- Expertise throws a wrench into the math, but this is also a problem in 5e, so whatever…
- This really only works for levels 1 through 12. (Baldurs Gate 3 did it right)

This is how I play. I actually take it a step further by using some optional rules from the DMG, plus the
Nimble 5e v1 extension, but the concept is the same; You are:


                                                        14
- Replacing the need for DCs with Ironsworn’s resolution mechanic
- Using your D&D 5e Character Sheet in place of Assets and Resources
- Cherry picking certain Ironsworn mechanics to map over to D&D 5e
- Using D&D 5e’s rules for Skill Checks and Combat
- Using Ironsworn’s Moves and gameplay loop for non-combat / the narrative

It works better than it sounds with a little creativity, and you get the best of both worlds!



Standalone
Of course, you don’t need a system at all if you don’t want. You can keep everything narrative, and just use
Fate Checks to replace Skill Checks. Use Likely for things your character is good at and Unlikely for things
your character is bad at. There is no DC, the Fate Check just gives you the result.

For example, if your character is good at jumping, ask “Do I make it across the gap?” by doing a Fate
Check as Likely. This replaces an Acrobatics or Athletics check. A “Yes But” may indicate that you jump the
gap, but hurt your leg on the landing.

This means you are running with no rules to fall back on, which will make resolving things more difficult,
but some people like the freeform style of play. Essentially this boils down to using a variant of the
“Resolve Risk” move from “Ironsworn Mini” discussed earlier:

                        Result                                                   Effect
                        Yes And                                          2 good things happen
                          Yes                                            1 good thing happens
                   Yes But / No But                                1 good and 1 bad thing happens
                          No                                             1 bad thing happens
                        No And                                           2 bad things happen

Mythic Primer
As Juice is based on the Mythic system, it helps to understand how Mythic works. I’m not going to go into
a lot of detail here, you should read Mythic GME 2e. But hopefully, the following is enough for you to get
started.



Fate Questions
The first cornerstone of Mythic is Fate Questions. These are Yes/No questions that you ask about the
world. Is the tavern busy? Mythic uses its Fate Chart to determine the answer as Yes or No. You can boil
anything down to a series of Yes/No questions to help determine what is happening.



Discover Meaning
But what about questions where the answer isn’t a simple Yes/No? What does the monster do? For this,
Mythic provides a large collection of Meaning Tables which are each lists of 100 words. You roll on a
meaning table and use the word pairings to spark your imagination for what the answer could be.
Meaning tables are designed to inspire, and you need to get creative to discover what your roll means.



Random Events
Asking a Fate Question opens the possibility for triggering a Random Event. When this happens, you roll
on a special table that dictates how your story might change. Random Events automatically prompt you to
do bookkeeping, integrate items from your lists into the adventure, or prompt for immersion checks and
NPC actions.



Lists
Mythic uses Lists to keep track of the “state” of your adventure. There is a list for Threads and a list for
Characters. Mythic GME 2e uses some really cool weighted list templates, and if you have access to them I
would recommend going this route. Otherwise, you can simply keep track of your lists using index cards
numbered 1-10. Your lists will be referenced by Random Events to keep them involved.



Threads
A Thread is like a side-story or side-quest. Well, your main quest is also a thread. Basically, your adventure
is composed of different threads that are interwoven to create your story. As you play, various threads will



                                                     16
“start” as you discover things in the world around you. You can choose to follow threads to see where they
go, or simply let them die off if they are not interesting. Random Events will prompt you to interact with or
clean up threads as you play.

Threads are similar to Vows in Ironsworn.



Characters
As you meet NPCs, you might choose to keep significant ones on your Character list. Random Events will
prompt you to interact with characters or cause them to take actions that affect the world around you.
Mythic also calls significant objects “Characters”.



Events
Sometimes there are certain things you want to have happen in your game. Mythic uses a powerful tool
called a Keyed Scene to handle this. Juice simplifies the concept by using an Event list coupled with a
Random Event trigger of Keyed Event, which will invoke an event from your list. You can use this to
customize the types of things that will happen during your adventure.



Locations
Mythic doesn’t use an official Locations list, but basically this is a list of locations in your world. This list will
be referenced by Juice’s Quest Generator, the Remote Event trigger, and the Settlement News feed. Similar
to Characters, this helps keep Locations that you have generated involved in your story.



Scenes
Mythic breaks your adventure into “Scenes”, much like watching a movie. Each scene will have some sort of
action or event occurring, interacting with certain people or objects. This all becomes the context for your
Fate Questions or Discover Meaning checks.

As your adventure progresses, you will naturally have an expectation for what the next scene might look
like. Mythic inserts some randomness between scenes to alter or interrupt your expectation to keep things
interesting.

Differences from Mythic
How is Juice different from Mythic?

Instead of a Fate Chart, Juice uses a variation of the Fate Check with different dice that allow for more
responses in a faster and more intuitive manner. It also doesn’t use a Chaos Factor.

Juice offers miniature handcrafted replacements for the main tables that Mythic relies on, such as:

- Discover Meaning
- Random Events

Juice adds optional lists for Events and Locations, and simplifies list management to index cards numbered
1 to 10.

Juice incorporates many of the lessons learned from Mythic Variations, Mythic Magazines, Crafter series,
and One Page series, such as:

- Interrupt Plot Points
- Detail Check
- NPC Behavior

Juice also cherry-picks features from other well known oracles, such as:

- Advantage mechanic for likeliness from MUNE
- “Invalid Assumption” from Recluse
- “Intensity” from the Motif Story Engine

Juice tries to blend with the freeform nature of Ironsworn / Winsome, while combining with specific aspects
of D&D 5e.

Juice puts a strong emphasis on Immersion as detailed in “DM Yourself”. If you use the 5e system, I HIGHLY
recommend “DM Yourself” (and it’s sequel, “DM Yourselves”) by Tom Scutt.

Along with all that, Juice provides a complete toolbox for developing a settlement, populating it with
people you can interact with, creating quests that send you out into the surrounding wilderness, exploring
a dungeon, and finding treasure.

All these tables and tools are compacted and streamlined into an index-card-sized document that you can
bring with you anywhere!

In other words, I cherry picked my favorite concepts from all over the place and brought them all together
into one cohesive system.

For more information, see “Inspirations” and “Credits” near the end of this document.

Main Innovations
So wait, is this just plagiarism?

That certainly isn’t my intention! I did my best to credit all my sources, and I release my work under CC-BY-
NC-SA to make sure no money can be earned from this. If you like what you see, send your donations to
Tana so she can keep producing the Mythic Magazines, and hit up the Credits at the end of this document
to find some other amazing content creators!

That said, while a lot of this is cobbled together from various sources, there certainly are plenty of original
innovations, the main ones being:

- Fate Check - In my opinion, an elegant conglomeration of multiple different oracles with a ton of
desirable properties.
- Name Generator - The most compact yet varied analog name generator out there.
- Wilderness Exploration Procedure - Seriously, if you know a way to get sensible biome transitions with
biome appropriate weather and monster encounters in less than an eighth of a page, let me know.
- Encounter Generator - No other encounter table I know of can produce such a variety of encounters that
are within the difficulty bounds of the PCs.

A lot of design (I have all the notes!) went into these particular pieces to produce a compact set of tables
and procedures that is just as capable as a full-blown system. I’d also like to think that combining it all
together is an innovation itself.




                                                      19
Modes
It may look like a simple pocketfold, but the tables of Juice were arranged and ordered in a very particular
and intentional way. This means the tool can be folded into specific “modes” for different purposes.



Simple Mode
There is a lot here, and it can be overwhelming. Luckily, there is a “Simple Mode” built right in! Open the
pocketfold up like a book, such that you have Fate Checks on the left, and Discover Meaning on the right.




This has everything you really need to play, mirroring the One Page Mythic:

- Fate Check for Yes / No questions
- Scene Changes and Interrupts
- NPC Behavior
- Name Generator
- Various Random Tables

If you are just starting out, practice the system in this mode first. Later on, you can start to incorporate
some of the other tables if you get stuck or need inspiration.

After using the Fate Check a few times, you will get the hang of it and not need the table.




                                                     20
> Pro Tip: When you roll a Random Event in this mode, use the “Modifier + Idea” tables to see what
happens. This way, you don’t need to flip over to the standard Random Event table.




                                               21
Abstract
Do you prefer pictures over words? From Simple Mode, open the right wing, then flip up the right flap to
use the Abstract Icons as your random table for Discover Meaning.




                                                  22
Pro Mode
Once you have used Juice a bit, you will most likely have the Fate Check and Next Scene mechanics
memorized, so you wont need that page visible anymore.

Along with that, I would recommend relying more on the Property and Detail tables instead of defaulting
to Discover Meaning. Therefore, “Pro Mode” is simply “Simple Mode”, but flipped over.




You will have the Random Event table, Challenge procedure, Detail tables, and Immersion tables visible;
arguably the most important tables Juice provides, in my opinion.




                                                  23
Wilderness Exploration
For “Wilderness Exploration” mode, open the book, fold it backwards on its spine, then open the left page.




Most of the things you need while exploring the wilderness will be visible.

You also have your NPC tables here, and if you flip the flap up, you have access to the extended NPC
tables.




                                                     24
Dungeon Exploration
For “Dungeon Exploration” mode, open the book, fold it backwards on its spine, then open the right page.




Most of the things you need for dungeon exploration will be visible.

From here, you can close the right flap over to the left to see Discover Meaning, or you can flip the flap up
to see Abstract Icons. Either of these options can be used to spark your imagination when generating and
exploring the dungeon.




                                                     25
Tables
The next section of the document will deep dive into each table, with tips on how to use them effectively.



General Tips
Each table is hand crafted with specific intention, both in word selection as well as order. Here are some
general tips that apply to all the tables:

- If a table is not sorted alphabetically, it generally means that a skewed roll has a meaningful effect. This
document will list skew effects for that table if applicable.

- Some tables are designed to be rolled with a d6 or a d10.

- The skew and die sizes are optional. You can just roll 1d10 on the tables for simplicity, nothing will break.

- If a table has entries in italics, it means that entry refers to another table.

And remember: There is no wrong way to play. There is no wrong way to use these tables. Everything is
optional.




                                                         26
Front
The Front page is my most used page. I use it to add flavor to just about anything.




                                                    27
Color
A list of colors with simple descriptors.

                          Roll                                               Color
                           1                                              Shade Black
                           2                                            Leather Brown
                           3                                            Highlight Yellow
                           4                                             Forest Green
                           5                                              Cobalt Blue
                           6                                             Crimson Red
                           7                                              Royal Violet
                           8                                             Metallic Silver
                           9                                              Midas Gold
                           0                                              Holy White

Use it whenever you need a color, such as:

- Eye / Hair color
- Armor accent colors
- Settlement banners / flags
- Dragon species

I also use Color + Object to name Establishments. More on this later.




                                                    28
Property
If you only take one table from this whole thing, take this one. Roll 1d10 to pick a property, then 1d6 to
pick an intensity. Do this twice.

                         Roll                                               Property
                          1                                                    Age
                          2                                                 Durability
                          3                                                 Familiarity
                          4                                                   Power
                          5                                                  Quality
                          6                                                   Rarity
                          7                                                    Size
                          8                                                    Style
                          9                                                   Value
                          0                                                  Weight

Use it to:

- Generate / Enhance an item
- Describe an NPC
- Describe a Settlement

Examples:

You find an object. It is…
1d10: 8, 1d6: 4, Result: Moderate Style
1d10: 4, 1d6: 1, Result: Minimal Power
Maybe a bandana?

You see a town in the distance…
1d10: 2, 1d6: 3, Result: Mundane Durability
1d10: 6, 1d6: 5, Result: Major Rarity
Pretty average, but you are surprised to even see such a settlement this far out here!




                                                    29
Detail
Do the random tables ever throw a curveball at you, and you don’t know how to interpret it? Use this table
to help ground the meaning a bit more to either a thread, character, or emotion. Try to use this table in
place of (or in combination with) “Discover Meaning”.

                          Roll                                                     Result

                         Skew                                                      Effect
                      Advantage                                        More Positive Outcomes
                     Disadvantage                                     More Negative Outcomes



Positive / Negative Emotion

The “thing” should evoke an emotion from your character. If you can’t think of an emotion, there is a list on
the “Immersion” table, under the “and it causes” header.

If you were rolling for a detail about a sword you found, and got “Negative Emotion -> Disgust”, then
perhaps this sword is jagged, rusted, and bloodstained.


Favors / Disfavors PC

Whatever this “thing” is, it dis/favors your PC.

Lets say you are in the dungeon, you stumble upon a mushroom. You want to know more about the
mushroom, so you roll a detail check and get “Disfavors PC”. Perhaps that mushroom has poisonous
spores!


Favors / Disfavors Thread

Roll on your Thread list. The “thing” has a detail that dis/favors that thread.



                                                      30
Lets say you find a letter on the ground. You want to know what it might say, so you roll a Detail Check and
get “Favors Thread”. You then roll on your thread list and get “Track down the enemy”. That must mean this
letter has a clue for where to find them!


Favors / Disfavors NPC

Roll on your Character list. The “thing” has a detail that dis/favors that character.

Maybe you just failed a Challenge, rolled on the Pay The Price table and got Surprise Complication. Unable
to think of one, you roll a Detail Check and get Favors NPC. Now, roll on the Character List. Somehow,
whatever complication occurs is beneficial for that NPC.




                                                       31
History
It can get quite overwhelming to try and fit every randomly generated element into the current scene.
Instead, use the History table to tie those elements to the past.

                        Roll                                                 Result
                          1                                                Backstory

                        Skew                                                 Effect
                     Advantage                                       Closer to the present
                    Disadvantage                                      Further into the past

> Previous: Most Recent
> Past: Any Except Most Recent

Lets say you trigger a random event during a Fate Check, and it prompts an NPC action. You then roll “NPC
talks”. You roll on the “Topic” table and get “History”. You then roll on this table, and get “Past Scene”.

This means that the NPC wants to talk about something that happened a while back. Maybe a choice that
has been bugging them, or maybe they thought of some new information from that scene.

For another example, lets say you rolled a Fate Check and got “Invalid Assumption”, but you don’t really
know what assumption it is referring to. Use this to narrow in on an assumption you made have made in
the past.

Or, perhaps you are talking with an NPC. The topic is “Reputation”, and for more details, you do a
Discover Meaning to get “Artificial Command”. You then want to ground this conversation to something
that happened in the past, so you roll and get “Previous Thread”.

This could mean that the NPC is talking about how they may have lied during the last mission in order to
make themselves seem more powerful than they really are. You could then consider consequences of that,
and how it may change things down the line.

The point is, not everything is about the present. Things are happening behind the scenes that you may not
be aware of, things have happened in the past of people’s lives that you only might be hearing about now.


                                                    32
> This is also a great way to initiate a flashback and play out a past scene, perhaps from a different
character’s perspective.




                                                 33
Immersion
Becoming your character is the best way to get an enjoyable experience out of a roleplaying session. Be
where your character is, see what they see, feel what they feel.

This is the perfect table to roll on anytime you are “stuck”, because it will generally provide some sort of
hint about the environment. I use it a lot when exploring a dungeon and deciding which way to go.

        Roll                  1-3                     4-6                     7-8                    9-0

> “and it causes” doubles as an Emotion table. The emotions are roughly paired with their opposites, and
subjectively ordered from most negative to most positive, with the “basic” emotions representing [“joy”,
“sadness”, “fear”, “anger”, “disgust”, “surprise”] all existing in the top 6 rows.

> When rolling for an emotion, also roll a 1dF. If you get “-“ or “blank”, use the bolded negative emotion.
If you get “+”, use the secondary positive emotion. I weighted it this way because I find that the darker
results present more interesting situations to overcome.

Back
The Back page contains the core game loop procedure of generating a quest, building challenges with
difficulties to solve for that quest, and determining the consequences of failing those challenges. The
Random Event table is also put here since it is used frequently enough during Fate Checks.




                                                  36
Quest
I’m the type of gamer that tends to generate lots of “sidequests” / Threads, then follow the ones I am
interested in. So I keep this table handy on the back. It references the other tables heavily to provide a lot
of variety, but due to this it sometimes take a little bit of interpretation and creativity to figure out the
meaning.

       Roll           Objective        Description          Focus           Preposition        Location
        1               Attain         Abandoned            Enemy             Around          Community
        2               Create             Cold             Monster           Behind        Dungeon Feature
        3               Deliver          Colorful            Event          In Front Of         Dungeon
        4              Destroy          Connected         Environment          Near           Environment
        5               Fetch              Dark           Community         On Top Of            Event
        6              Infiltrate        Friendly           Person               At         Natural Hazard
        7             Investigate         Hidden          Information          From             Outpost
        8             Negotiate          Mystical          Location          Inside Of         Settlement
        9              Protect           Remote             Object          Outside Of       Transportation
        0              Survive          Wounded               Ally             Under           Wilderness
                                                                                                Feature

Generating a quest involves a lot of rolls, due to the number of tables that are references (see the entries
in italics). The result will read almost like an English sentence if you squint hard enough.


Examples

1: Attain, 7: Hidden, 5: Community, 0: Under, 1: Community
“Attain the hidden community under the community”
You could interpret this as gaining trust with a secret society present in the city, like an underground spy
network or smugglers for the black market.

4: Destroy, 1: Abandoned, 3: Event -> 6: Discovery, 8: Inside Of, 4: Environment -> 5: Grassland
“Destroy the abandoned discovery in the grasslands”
Perhaps ruins were recently discovered, with magical symbols that might open a portal to who-knows-
where. Wouldn’t want some big monster coming through that!

5: Fetch, 4: Connected, 9: Object -> 3: Cauldron, 1: Around, 8: Settlement -> 5/6: Raven River
“Fetch the connected cauldron around Raven River”
Seems like some Hags might be performing some sort of ritual that is endangering the people of Raven
River. Go stop the spell before they finish.


Rumors

This table can double as a Rumor Generator. Just make it past tense and prepend it with “I heard…”



                                                     37
Examples:

- I heard that someone attained the hidden community under the community
- I heard that someone destroyed the abandoned discovery in the grasslands
- Did you hear? Someone fetched the connected cauldron around Raven River!

Quests are usually prompts for your character to take action, while Rumors are information about actions
that others have taken in the recent past. Rumors can lead to quests if your character chooses to act on
that information, but either way it helps make your world feel more alive, that things are happening without
your character’s involvement.




                                                    38
Random Event
This is an alternative Random Event table to replace the one provided by Mythic. You will be rolling on this
any time you get double blanks on a Fate Check, where the primary die is on the left.

This table is specifically designed to trigger things that are easy to forget during a session.

                         Roll                                                   Result
                           1                                                Advance Time
                           2                                                Close Thread
                           3                                              Converge Thread
                           4                                               Diverge Thread
                           5                                                  Immersion
                           6                                                 Keyed Event
                           7                                                New Character
                           8                                                 NPC Action
                           9                                                  Plot Armor
                           0                                                Remote Event


Advance Time

When this triggers, time in-game has advanced. Maybe day turns to night, maybe the season changes,
maybe the guards change their patrol, maybe that ritual the villain was performing is complete. Take some
time to do some bookkeeping; Roll on the weather table to change the weather, if you are in a settlement,
roll on the News table to see what is happening. Check your torches, eat a ration, etc.


Close Thread

Roll on your thread list. That thread has ended. Determine why, and what it means for the story going
forward. Then remove it from the list.

New threads will naturally form as you play, through sidequests, information from NPCs, etc. However, you
can generally only follow one thread at a time, and as time passes it is only natural for other threads to
end without your intervention.


Converge Thread

Roll on your thread list. Something has happened that moves you closer to that thread, potentially joining
and intertwining with the thread you are currently on.

Sometimes, seemingly unrelated storylines become more connected than you first thought. When this is
revealed, creating a coherent reason can produce an exciting and complex plot.




                                                      39
Diverge Thread

Roll on your thread list. Something has happened that moves you away from that thread. If you land on the
current thread, perhaps the current thread splits into two threads.

Bad things happen. Sometimes your character gets distracted. Sometimes outside forces are at work to
prevent you from achieving your goals. Sometimes you come to a fork in the road and need to make a
difficult choice.


Immersion

Roll on the Immersion table and incorporate the results into what is currently happening.

Solo Roleplaying is at its best when you are immersed in your character and the world around you. This
random event trigger is intended to keep you there.


Keyed Event

Sometimes, you have something you WANT to happen, but don’t feel like “cheating” by explicitly making it
happen. This is the solution. You can even keep a Keyed Event list to roll on and ensure that the things you
want to happen, happen. Think of it like a timer.

Examples are:

- Random Zombie Attack
- The BBEG appears
- Earthquake!
- The Ritual is Complete

If you don’t have any Keyed Events written down that you want to happen, you can roll a Plot Point and
incorporate it into the story instead.


New Character

A new NPC is present in the scene. Roll on the NPC and Name tables, and add it to your character list.
Keep in mind that “Characters” don’t necessarily need to be people; maybe this is a sentient sword, a
dragon, or an extremely important plot-based item?

I believe that the NPCs are what make the world come alive. They have motives, they affect and change the
world around them, they are sources of quests and information. This event explicitly injects them into the
story.


NPC Action

Roll on the Characters list. That NPC performs an action. If the chosen NPC isn’t around, you can do a
quick flashback / temporary scene change, you can come up with an idea that directly affects (or was



                                                    40
affected by) that character, or you can simply default to your companion.

Again, NPCs make the world feel alive. The people around you aren’t just sitting around idle, they should
act on their own.


Plot Armor

A lot of the tables in this oracle lean towards the negative. Challenges, obstacles, and setbacks are what
make a story interesting. However, there are times when you could really use a hand.

If you get a Plot Armor random event, then whatever issue you are dealing with is solved. This is your
lifeline in an otherwise unforgiving world.


Remote Event

Something happens in a far away place. If you are maintaining a Locations list, roll on it. Otherwise, use the
Location Grid to determine where this event occurs.

While a majority of the story will follow your character, you must remember that the rest of the world is still
progressing forward. Things will happen far away that your character does not yet know about, but might
become known or relevant in the future.

Incorporate the results of this into News that you roll on next time you are in a Settlement.




                                                      41
Challenge
One of the core concepts of the game is overcoming challenges. Solo-first games like Ironsworn handle
this elegantly, however social games like D&D 5e require a DM to create situations and challenges, and set
DCs accordingly.

Here, we are going to do things backwards. Roll a physical challenge and a mental challenge, then create a
situation where these challenges make sense. Assign each challenge a DC, and require the PC to pass only
one of them; otherwise, they must Pay The Price. By having two challenges, you are less likely to get locked
out of the success path.

This is a great way to set up a random scene, because trying to invent a situation that involves the two
rolled challenges will create an interesting scenario. It is kinda like a mini-game.

The Challenges are all based on D&D 5e skills, but that doesn’t mean it is only applicable to the D&D 5e
system. You can use whatever applicable skills your character has to solve the challenge.

                Roll                        Physical Challenge                  Mental Challenge

Completely Random

Simply roll a 1d10 and you have your DC. Swingy.


Balanced Challenge

Roll 1d100 on the right column to get a bell curve that weights towards the middle of the table to get a
balanced DC. The curve mimics rolling 3d10 and choosing the middle result.

> Pro Tip: You can also use this to map back to the left column to get 1-10 weighted towards the middle,
which can be used for a variety of things.


Easy Challenge

Roll 1d10 (or 1d100) with Advantage to skew towards the lower DCs.


Hard Challenge

Roll 1d10 (or 1d100) with Disadvantage to skew towards the higher DCs.


Quick Challenge

Ignore the table completely and roll 2d6+6.

Fate Check
Ah, the Fate Check. This is where Juice started out so very long ago.

As much as I like the Mythic system, I never liked the Fate Chart. I wanted answers quickly, without needing
to remember state, deal with math and modifiers, or do complicated table lookups.

I also wanted more than just Yes and No. I wanted the Ands, the Buts, the Invalid Assumptions. I wanted the
ability to skew Likeliness. I wanted to have it ever so slightly tipped in the Yes-But direction to mimic the
Ironsworn Weak Hit probabilities, but I also wanted to dissuade phrasing the question to take advantage
of the “Yes” skew. And of course, I needed Random Event triggering at a reasonable rate that still gave an
answer to the question being asked.

And as complicated as that requirement list is, this HAD to be intuitive and easy to memorize.

Thus, Juice’s Fate Check was born, using Fate dice (haha at the unfortunate naming collision).
If you are not aware, the TTRPG “Fate” uses special dice, where two sides have a “+” sign, two sides are
blank, and two sides have a “-“ sign. D&D 5e, the most popular TTRPG, doesn’t use them, so you could say
they aren’t that common, however you probably won’t have any issue finding them at your local game
store. Otherwise, see the “Requirements” section earlier in this document for alternatives.

With Juice’s Fate Check, you pretty much just need to remember that “+” is good and “-“ is bad. Use two
different colored dice, and designate one as your “primary” die.

For the tables, I represent the blank side using a zero (0).

Before we look at the full table, try to understand just the basics:

                          2dF                                                  Result
                          ++                                                   Yes And
                          +0                                                     Yes
                          +-                                                   Yes But


                          -+                                                   No But
                          -0                                                     No
                           --                                                  No And

If you can remember that “+ -“ means “Good-Bad” (Yes, But…), then the roll results will be very intuitive. If
the Primary die is “+”, the result is always Yes-like. If the Primary die is “-“, the result is always No-like.

So what if the Primary die is blank? Then we look to the secondary die:

                          2dF                                                  Result
                          0+                                                  Favorable



                                                       47
                         0-                                                Unfavorable

Note that Favorable doesn’t mean “Yes”, it means “Good”. That is, the answer to your question is whatever
is most favorable to your character. If you are looking for someone and you ask “Is the tavern busy?” and
get Favorable, then perhaps the answer is No because that would mean it is easy to spot the person you
are looking for. However, if you are trying to hide from someone and you ask “Is the tavern busy?” and get
Favorable, then perhaps the answer is Yes because that would mean it will be easier for you to remain
hidden in the crowd.

That leaves double blanks, and this part is probably the most complicated part of the Fate Check. Double
blanks mean one of two things: Random Event or Invalid Assumption. How do you know which? Look at the
position of the Primary die on the table; If it is on the left, then you triggered a Random Event (and the
answer to your question is “Yes But”). If it is on the right, your answer is “Invalid Assumption”. This is
represented in the table like this:

                         2dF                                                  Result
                         <0                                          Yes But + Random Event
                         >0                                             Invalid Assumption



Random Event

If you get double blanks with the primary die to the left of the secondary die, the answer to your question
is “Yes But”, and you trigger a Random Event. Roll on the Random Event table and incorporate that into the
scene or story. In “Simple” mode, you can roll on the “Modifier + Idea” table to determine what alterations
happen to the current scene.


Invalid Assumption

Something about your question was built on a false assumption. For example, if you ask “Is the tavern
busy?” and get “Invalid Assumption”, this might mean the tavern is closed; you assumed it was open but
that ended up being an invalid assumption. It forces you to go back and reevaluate what you think you
know. In a way, it introduces its own expectation subversion into the scene.


Why complicate the double blanks?

The reason for this distinction is due to the math. With two Fate dice, there are 9 possible results, meaning
each result has an 11% chance of being rolled. In the past, double blanks was assigned to “Invalid
Assumption + Random Event”. But an 11% random event rate is too high; Mythic at Chaos Factor 5 is
about 5%. And I didn’t like that whenever I got a random event, it meant my question wasn’t really
answered; I had to come up with a reason my question was invalid AND I had to resolve the random event,
it was too jarring all at once.

By using the position of the dice to differentiate, we get a 5.5% Random Event rate, with a much-less-
intrusive 5.5% Invalid Assumption rate. In addition, we always get an answer to the question when a
Random Event is triggered, AND we get a skew towards “Yes But”.




                                                    48
Why the skew? To mirror Ironsworn. Ironsworn at +1 has a 55% chance of scoring a hit (15% Strong Hit,
40% Weak Hit), and 45% chance of getting a miss. At +2, there is a 67% chance to hit and 33% chance to
miss.

Juice has a 50% chance of producing a Yes-like result (11% “Yes-And, mirroring the Strong Hit), and a 44%
chance of producing a No-like result (The remainder is “Invalid Assumption”). With “Likely”, this raises to
66% Yes-like and 33% No-like. It directly aligns with Ironsworn’s hit rate at +1 and +2.

This both emphasizes “partial success with a complication” (which is arguably the most “fun” result for solo
roleplaying) and allows you to use Juice’s Fate Check to replace stats in Standalone mode (see earlier in
this document).


Likeliness

Its already been mentioned a few times, but how do we handle Likeliness? It is simple: “+” means “Yes”. If
either die is a “+”, your result will be Yes-like.

Unlikely? “-“ means “No”. If either die is a “-“, your result will be No-like.


The Table

Whew! Without further ado, here is the full table for the Fate Check. However, if you read the above, then
you already have it memorized :wink:

         1d10                    2dF                  Normal                     Likely     Unlikely
           0                     ++                   Yes And                Yes And         Yes And
           9                     +0                Yes Because                    Yes          Yes
           8                     +-                   Yes But                    Yes But     No But
           7                     0+                  Favorable                    Yes          Yes

                                                      Event
           5                     >0             Invalid Assumption                Yes          No
           4                     0-                Unfavorable                    No           No
           3                     -+                   No But                     Yes But     No But
           2                     -0                 No Because                    No           No
           1                     --                   No And                 No And          No And

Why the 1d10 column? If you don’t have any Fate Dice, you can just roll 1d10 to get your answer. For likely,
you can either use the Likely column, or roll with advantage on the Normal column. It isn’t as easy to
remember as “+ -“ is “Good-Bad”, but the table itself is always visible in “Simple” mode. The probabilities
change a bit too, however Juice is all about adapting to what works best for you.


But wait, there’s more!

When rolling a Fate Check, you roll 2dF + 1d6. The 1d6 comes from the Intensity table. (I like to choose to
have the d6 be the same color as my primary die to help me remember which is which). The Intensity will



                                                        49
give you a scale for how much the answer matters.

For example, “Is the tavern busy?” with a “Yes Because” result and an intensity of “Minor” might mean it is
busier than usual for a Tuesday afternoon because of a birthday party, whereas “Yes Because” with an
intensity of “Major” might mean it is packed tight, perhaps due to a popular band playing live music.

The “Because” results are designed to prompt you to come up with a reason for the Yes or No, and use
the Intensity as a way to scale that reason.

Intensity is easy to remember: The larger the number, the more intense the reason.


Pictures

Here are some pictures of Fate Check rolls using the Android app “Dice” by “7Pixels”. My Primary die is
green. See if you can interpret the rolls:




                                           Yes, Because (Minor)




                                           No, But (Moderate)




                                           Favorable (Minimal)




                                                    50
                                            No, And (Mundane)




                                      Yes, But (Major) + Random Event
                                    (The primary is left of the secondary)




                                             Yes, But (Maximum)



Lets look at some examples for how to interpret the results:

Example 1

John is chasing the bandit through the street, when suddenly the bandit turns and runs into the tavern to
try and slip away. John rushes into the tavern.

Fate Check: “Is the tavern busy?”

+03 : Yes, the tavern is pretty busy. It must be the dinner rush. John can't find the bandit in the crowd.
+06 : Yes, the tavern is very busy, is there some sort of event going on in town?
++2 : Yes, the tavern is busy, and there seems to be a band playing tonight. The music drowns out the
sound of voices.
++5 : Yes, the tavern is very busy, and someone is buying rounds of drinks for all the patrons! Its difficult
to move here.
+-1 : Yes, its busy, but they might be closing soon. Better act quickly!
+-4 : Yes, its busy, but a fight has broken out and some patrons are leaving to avoid it.



                                                     51
0+3 : No, its not busy, John is able to spot the bandit immediately. The chase continues! (Favorable)
0-4 : Yes, its so busy that the bandit was able to hide in the crowd. Time to start searching... (Unfavorable)
-+1 : No, its not busy, but there is a large group at one of the tables gambling. Do they know where the
bandit went?
-+6 : No, but there is an important noble at the bar. Better not cause too big of a scene...
--6 : No, and there aren't even any bartenders. Are they helping the bandit escape out the back?
>01 : Wait a minute, this tavern is closed... (Invalid Assumption)
>06 : Wait a minute, this isn't a tavern, this is a front for a secret hideout! (Invalid Assumption)



Example 2

Alice is searching for food in the forest, when she comes across a large blue mushroom growing on a
tree.

Fate Check: “Is it poisonous?”

+03 : Yes, better keep searching. Alice is running out of energy...
-01 : Not poisonous, also not that tasty...
-05 : No, Alice recognizes this variety, it will make a yummy dinner!
++1 : Yes, and simply touching it will leave a rash on her skin.
++6 : Yes, and just breathing in the spores will paralyze her!
-+2 : No, but there must be a reason the animals aren't eating it...
+-4 : Yes, but in more of a hallucinogenic way.
--2 : No, and nearby she finds an animal eating another one. Hunting opportunity?
0+3 : Yes, however she can use it to coat her weapon with poison. (Favorable)
0-4 : Yes, it indicates that the fruit of the tree is also poisonous. The same fruit she ate earlier today!
(Unfavorable)
>04 : As she reaches for the mushroom, it retracts into the tree. Was it creature of some sort? (Invalid
Assumption)
>01 : She thought it was a mushroom, but it was actually a blue piece of paper nailed to the tree. What
does it say? (Invalid Assumption)

You can see how a simple Fate Check can lead to so many different outcomes by combining the result with
an intensity, then crafting a scenario that would lead to that answer.

Next Scene
At the end of a scene, you probably have an idea of what the next scene may look like. Mythic prompts
you to challenge that expectation, and Juice does it in a more streamlined fashion.

                         -0                                                  Normal
                         --                                           Interrupt (Unfavorable)

Roll 2dF. If you get any blanks, its a normal scene that proceeds as you expected.

If your primary is “+”, then you alter the scene by either adding or removing a Focus. Roll on the Focus
table to determine how to modify the scene.

In “Simple” mode, you can instead roll on the “Modifer + Idea” tables and use that result to alter your
scene.

If the primary is “-“, then your expected scene is interrupted. An interruption might be favorable or
unfavorable to your current situation. Roll on the Plot Point table, use the result to determine what the
interruption is.


Example

Your character has just rented a room at an Inn and is headed to bed. You expect the next scene to be
them waking up in the morning.

Rolling a “Normal” result means they wake up in the morning just as you expected.

“Alter (Add)” with a focus of “Ally” might mean that they wake up to a knock on the door. A friend is here.

“Alter (Remove)” with a focus of “Environment -> Arctic” could be interpreted as it being an extremely hot
morning; clear skies and strong sunlight. This might mean certain market stalls aren’t open in favor of
staying indoors, for example.

“Interrupt (Favorable)” with a Plot Point of “Reinforcements” could mean that you are jolted awake in the
middle of the night by the local sheriff thwarting a thief breaking into the building next door.




                                                     53
“Interrupt (Unfavorable)” with a Plot Point of “Battle” could mean that you are visited by an assassin in the
middle of the night and combat breaks out.




                                                     54
Expectation
An “Expectation Check” is an alternative way to resolve questions, situations, and NPC behavior. It is a bit
more generic than a simple Fate Check.

                          2dF                                                     Result
                          ++                                             Expected (Intensified)
                          +0                                                     Expected
                          +-                                              Next Most Expected
                          0+                                                    Favorable
                          00                                                   Modified Idea
                          0-                                                   Unfavorable
                          -+                                              Next Most Expected
                          -0                                                     Opposite
                           --                                            Opposite (Intensified)

There are different types of players. Some people question everything. Some people just go with the flow.
Some people like to randomize everything, while others simply want to journal.

I’m the type of player that likes to randomize almost everything. The “puzzle” is then trying to take the
chaos and make it coherent. Because of that, I rely on random tables quite heavily (hence this project). I
never know what is coming next. Mythic-style sandbox play fits this well. Players like me probably utilize the
Fate Check heavily, because anything else feels like “cheating”.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are players that know how they want the story to play out, and
enjoy “playing it out”. It is borderline writing a book, but with some dice. They may do some Fate Checks
here and there, but otherwise all they really need is a name generator and they are good to go. “The
Adventure Crafter” fits this style well - generate the main parts of the adventure in advance, then play it out
and journal it.

This “Expectation Check” is designed for the second type; People who know where they are headed, but
still want some sense of randomness to differentiate it from literally writing a book. It works best if you
have a pretty good idea of what could happen (an expectation), but still want some surprise sprinkled in.

This is essentially a generic variant of Tana’s NPC Behavior check from Mythic Magazine #9. As such, it also
conveniently works for emulating NPC Behavior, especially in the “Simple Mode”, so you don’t need to flip
the pages to find the NPC tables. Even the double blank result keeps you on the same page.

Examples:

Our character has just entered the local tavern, just as the sun is setting.

Playstyle 1 would probably do a Fate Check for “Is the tavern busy?”, get the answer, then come up with a
logical reason for that answer.



                                                       55
Playstyle 2 would instead expect that the tavern is probably busy, then do an Expectation Check to see if
they are right, if they want to.

The difference is that in Playstyle 1, the player wants an answer, while in Playstyle 2, the player already
knows the answer, but might want to challenge it to see if it changes.

It is subtle, but I’m trying to distinguish between the “Mythic” style of play and the “Adventure Crafter” style
of play, and I wanted checks that incorporate both in Juice, so that the user can decide. They are both
available in “Simple” mode as well!

By the way, there is nothing wrong with blending the two play styles. For example, rolling a Fate Check as
“Likely” means that you already have some expectation of the result.


NPC Behavior

As I mentioned, Mythic Magazine #9 actually introduced this “Expectation Check” as an alternative form of
NPC Behavior generation. The article doesn’t directly describe it as I do above, however it generalizes well.
The basic idea is to come up with an expectation of what the NPC will do given the current context, then
“test” it to see if you are correct. In play, this generally means you need to come up with the most-likely
and next-most-likely actions, as the results will gravitate towards one of these (or the complete opposite,
which is usually apparent).

In “Simple Mode” you don’t have access to the NPC tables on the inner pages, therefore the Expectation
Check doubles as the NPC Behavior generator exactly how the article describes.




                                                      56
Intensity
Intensity is a simple d6 roll to determine how much effect something has. It is most often used as part of a
Fate Check to determine how much weight the answer has, but it is also used with the Property table to
determine the strength of each property.

                         Roll                                                Result
                          1                                                 Minimal
                          2                                                  Minor
                          3                                                 Mundane

I chose to use the “six M’s” to make it easier to remember.




                                                    57
Scale
Sometimes you want to scale a value. I use this frequently for checking shop prices or adjusting the stats of
a monster.

Don’t use a Fate Check to ask “Is there a discount on this item?”. Instead, imagine what the normal price is,
then roll for Scale. Whatever the result, come up with an in-game reason for that result.

Same with monster stats; Scale a random encounter’s HP. Higher than expected? This monster is strong,
how has it survived this long? Lower than expected? Maybe the monster has been wounded for some
reason… Come up with in-game explanations for the results.

The 2dF + 1d6 acts as a curve towards the middle of the table, to give balanced results. For this table, a
“+” or “-“ is interpreted as “+1” or “-1”, so you add the values together. “++3” is “1+1+3 = 5” meaning a
10% increase.

If you are specifically trying to scale something larger, just use the absolute value of the roll. For example,
a roll of “1” normally means “-25%”, but since you are trying to scale it up, just use “+25%”. Vice versa with
smaller.

                      2dF + 1d6                                                Result

The first word will be either an adjective or a verb. The second word will be a noun or noun-verb. This way,
the pairing will be grammatically correct. They are sorted such that the “best 10” of the 20 are at the top,
so if you don’t have a d20, you can use a d10.

Examples:

- 10,16: Unexpected Failure
- 14,19: Deceive Sacrifice
- 4,18: Dangerous Leave

Where did these words come from? I compiled a large list from various tables in the Mythic lineup and
Ironsworn/Delve/Starforged, did some complicated filtering on frequency, parts of speech, synonym/
antonym counts, similarity clustering, and finally a diversity filter using an embedding model. The list you
see above was then cherry picked by hand from that resulting distillation of 50 words. See https://
github.com/jrruethe/wordlist_filter if you want the code.

Name Generator
A good name generator is one of the most important tools for Solo Roleplaying, and because of this, a lot
of time was spent on this.

Some of the names generated may be a bit unorthodox, but the goal was to satisfy these requirements:

- Every name be easily pronounceable
- Easy to generate both masculine and feminine sounding endings
- Names consist of 2-4 syllables
- Names consist of 4-10 letters
- Names have a wide variety, more than just 20^3 variations
- Entire table fits on 1/8 of a page
- Simple enough to just roll 3d20, but when the more complicated usage should be intuitive

For Column 1, rows 1-5 should be Vowels if they are the start of the name, and the double-letter pairings if
they are the middle or end of the name.

For Column 3, the top half of the table (1-10) will give more masculine sounding endings, while the bottom
half (11-20) will give more feminine sounding endings.




                                                    62
Simple Method

Roll 3d20 on columns 1,2,3 for a random name.
Examples:

- 20,8,12: Tolimaea
- 9,16,19: Mayosid
- 16,6,2: Nenetar

You can also roll on column 1 three times for a similar effect:

- 8,15,11: Limibe
- 16,3,14: Nevile
- 1,20,13: Atoki


Pattern Method

The “Pattern” column dictates which columns to roll on, which half of the table, and any suffixes to append.

Only the “3” will be followed by “+/-“. If you see that, roll 1d10 on the higher / lower half of the table. A “3”
with no “+/-“ following it means use the 1d20.

Some patterns will append a suffix of “o”, “a”, or “i”.

For example:

- “12o” : Roll 1d20 on Column 1, 1d20 on Column 2, then append an “o”.
- “23+”: Roll 1d20 on Column 2, 1d10 on the bottom half (bigger numbers) of column 3.
- “111”: Roll 1d20 on Column 1, three times.
- “123-a”: Roll 1d20 on Column 1, 1d20 on Column 2, 1d10 on the top half (smaller numbers) of Column 3,
then append an “a”.

The Pattern column itself is arranged such that rolling 1d20 with disadvantage will lean towards masculine
sounding names, while 1d20 with advantage will lean towards feminine sounding names.

Here are some examples:

Masculine-sounding:

- 1d20 (Dis): 11 -> “111” -> 4,5,9 -> Osuma
- 1d20 (Dis): 2 -> “12” -> 8,7 -> Likel
- 1d20 (Dis): 6 -> “23-“ -> 2,1 -> Risan

Feminine-sounding:

- 1d20 (Adv): 16 -> “23-i” -> 16,3 -> Nedeli
- 1d20 (Adv): 14 -> “12i” -> 2,16 -> Eyosi



                                                          63
- 1d20 (Adv): 19 -> “123-i” -> 12,17,8 -> Dagranoni


Interpretation

The name generator will generate a mix of syllable counts, and will generally be pronounceable. That said,
some of the names might be a bit weird. Feel free to use the names as inspiration and alter them as you
see fit.

For example, I generated “Kicora”, but that didn’t roll off the tongue too well, so I changed it to “Kisora”.
“Nevile” might get changed to “Neville”, and “Beneti” might get changed to “Benettie”.

Random Tables
“Discover Meaning” will always provide an abstract concept, but sometimes you need something a bit
more concrete. Here are some very basic random tables for nouns.

       Roll            Modifier         Idea            Event         Person           Object
         1              Change        Attention        Ambush         Criminal         Arrow
         2             Continue     Communication      Anomaly       Entertainer       Candle
         3             Decrease        Danger          Blessing        Expert         Cauldron
         4                  Extra      Element         Caravan         Mage             Chain
         5              Increase        Food             Curse       Mercenary          Claw
         6             Mundane         Home            Discovery       Noble            Hook
         7            Mysterious      Resource          Escape         Priest        Hourglass
         8                  Start      Rumor            Journey       Ranger            Quill
         9                  Stop       Secret          Prophecy       Soldier           Rose
         0              Strange         Vow              Ritual     Transporter         Skull


Modifier + Idea

These two together replace the Random Event table when using “Simple” mode. They can also used when
the “Next Scene” is “Altered”.

Examples:

- 9,5: Stop Food
- 0,7: Strange Resource
- 5,1: Increase Attention

The Modifier table comes from Mythic Magazine #38.


Event

Random Events are more like triggers that something in the scene needs to change. But if you need a
literal random Event, this is your table. Perfect for when you need something to happen.


Person

Used when generating an NPC, this is their primary identity.
These are loosely based on D&D 5e classes and backgrounds.


Object



                                                  67
The “Object” table in particular may feel limiting, but these words were chosen specifically due to the wide
variety of concepts they evoke. Cauldron could also mean soup / food, Quill could also mean letter, etc.

This is primarily for getting an object in “Simple” mode. There is a full blown “Object / Treasure” table that
you should probably be using instead.

I also use Color + Object when naming Establishments.

Inside 1




Wilderness Exploration
The Wilderness Exploration tables are much more intentional than they first appear. The tables are built on
offsets from your current state in order to provide natural results.

Type and Environment
The Type and Environment tables are placed in this order such that the two words make grammatical
sense, however you actually roll on the Environment table first and the Type table second.

If you need a random Environment, you just roll a 1d10. However, more likely your character is in an
existing environment and is rolling to explore the next hex, and therefore needs an adjacent environment.
In this case, roll 2dF, add the results together, and use it as an offset from your current environment.

For example, we are in the forest, and we are traversing into the next hex.
2dF -> (0, +) -> (+1). So the next hex is +1 from Forest aka down the table to Swamp.

The 2dF creates a curve centered at 0 which means adjacent hexes will likely be the same or off-by-1 (but
up to 2 away) from your current hex. The table is ordered in a way that biome transitions make sense, and
the weighting creates large biomes with gentle transitions.

After obtaining an Environment result, roll 1dF. Use that offset to select the Type. Each Environment can be
paired to 3 types, and the Type column is ordered in a way to make each Type/Environment pairing natural
and meaningful.

For example, our Forest can be:

- Scrub Forest: Small, scrappy trees speckled about
- Tropical Forest: Like a rainforest
- Dark Forest: Plenty of thick trees that block the sun

The Type offset does not wrap around; The Arctic is likely to be Snowy, and the Desert is likely to be Arid.

The same procedure applies to the transition. If we were in a Scrub Forest, and we rolled 2dF -> (0, +) ->
(+1) to get Swamp, we then roll 1dF for the type. If we get (+), then have transitioned from a Scrub Forest
to an Exotic Swamp. I picture this as being something similar to a hag’s home, slightly foggy with a ton of
gnarly dead trees, and we come up to a sunken bog with the sound of mud bubbles randomly popping.

Snowy Arctic may transition into Expansive Mountains, which may transition into Rocky Caverns or Windy
Hills.


Header

The header tries to capture the above rules in a compact and codified way. It reads:

2dF Env -> 1dF Type

Which reminds you to always first roll 2dF as an offset from your current environment, then roll 1dF as an
offset from that new environment to get its type.

Natural Hazard

Roll on the Natural Hazard table.

Roll a change to the weather. See the later section for how this works.


Challenge



                                                     72
Perform the Challenge procedure.


Dungeon

You found a dungeon that you can explore! Generate a name and dive in.


Road / River

You find a road or river. You can choose to follow it to see where it leads. Feel free to use the location grid
if you want help drawing the direction on the map.

If you were lost, you are able to use the road / river to reorient yourself, and are no longer lost.


Feature

You found a unique feature, something special or important. Roll on the Feature table to determine what.


Settlement / Camp

You found a settlement (or possibly a camp if settlement doesn’t make sense in the current context). Read
about settlements later in this document. A camp can be a small, safe place where you meet other NPCs,
can share a meal, or trade. Although, depending on the circumstances, a camp doesn’t necessarily HAVE to
be safe; it could be a bandit camp.


Advance Plot

Even if you are just out exploring without a specific destination in mind, there is most likely a reason.
Whatever you find in this hex helps you advance the plot; something crucial to your current thread or story.


Destination / Lost

If you are journeying with a specific purpose (a place you are trying to get to, or a thing you are looking
for), then you found it. If you were just exploring, you are now Lost.

Use your best judgment here, if you are just setting out and your first roll is “Destination”, you might
decide to change it to “Lost” instead to avoid having a very anti-climatic journey. The opposite is true too,
if you have been exploring for a while and decide you are ready to find a settlement and rest, then
“Destination” can also mean “Settlement”; you don’t need to wait for a roll of 8. Similarly, if you are out
looking for a specific dungeon, you can treat “5: Dungeon” as possibly being a different, random dungeon
you stumbled upon, while “0: Destination” is the specific dungeon you were looking for.


Lost and Found
While exploring, you will inevitably get lost. This happens when rolling a 10 and you don’t have a particular
destination in mind. All this means mechanically is that you start using a d6 to roll on the encounter table.



                                                      73
This will limit your rolls towards the more dangerous results. You don’t need to worry about hex drift or
anything like that.

If you get a 6: River/Road, these are generally good enough landmarks such that you can orient yourself.
After getting a 6, you are no longer lost, and can switch back to using a d10 again.

The “Lost / Found” cycle is intended to extend your exploration and offer more varied encounter results. It
nudges things slightly towards the more dangerous section of the table to keep things interesting, without
getting caught in a death spiral.

This aligns well with the skew mechanic. If you are traveling with a detailed map or guide, you are more
likely to reach your destination sooner. And if you do get lost, you are more likely to find a Road / River
and reorient. While it may feel weird that having a map or guide skews you towards the “Lost” result more,
the mechanical effect is that you will reorient yourself much more quickly. Having a map or guide means
you are less likely to run into trouble, but even with a map it is not uncommon to briefly become
disoriented; the key is that it is easy to get back on track. And the map is well worth it since it keeps you
away from the more dangerous encounters at 1-4. However, you will need to find an “Artisan -> Artist
(Cartographer)” in a Settlement to purchase a good one.


Dangerous Territory / Difficult Terrain
Your journey may pass through a hostile or treacherous area. This is represented by rolling with
disadvantage on the Encounter table, which greatly increases the likelihood of running into natural hazards
and monsters. Skewing the encounters is my alternative to dealing with half-speed pace, as that is too
tedious to track. Instead of saying “This terrain is difficult, so you can only cover X hexes per day”, I say
“This terrain is difficult, so you are more likely to run into obstacles that will take time to overcome”.

Having a map or guide negates the disadvantage, you will just do straight rolls.




                                                    74
Weather
The Weather table is not intended to be a random 1d10. It wouldn’t really make sense for it to snow in the
hot desert.

Instead, you are going to compose the roll based on the current Type and Environment. That is to say,
each Type and Environment combo has specific weather results tailored to it.

                         Roll                                                Weather
                           1                                                  Blizzard
                           2                                               Snow Flurries
                           3                                               Freezing Cold
                           4                                              Thunder Storm
                           5                                                Heavy Rain
                           6                                                 Light Rain
                           7                                               Heavy Clouds
                           8                                                High Winds
                           9                                                 Clear Skies
                           0                                              Scorching Heat

So how does it work? First, look at your current environment on the table. You will see [“-“, “0”, “+”]
symbols. This directly maps to [“Disadvantage”, “Straight”, “Advantage”].

Next, look at your current type on the table. You will see “+x” modifiers from 0 to 4.

Simply roll 1d6 at your skew, and add the modifier. That result is the row you use for determining the
weather.

For example, in the Rocky Arctic, we roll “1d6@Disadvantage +2”. This means our weather can vary from
Freezing Cold to High Winds, but will be skewed towards the colder side.

If we were on the Sandy Coast, we roll “1d6 +4”, which means the weather could range equally from Heavy
Rain to Scorching Heat. It will never snow on a Sandy Coast.

Furthermore, each weather result comes straight out of Kibbles Reasonable Weather Effects: https://
www.gmbinder.com/pdf/-M6xAC_2zw4BzpByxO-c/finalDocument.pdf

This means you have optional and balanced D&D 5e compatible mechanics for each weather result that
you can apply to your game.


Header

The header tries to codify the above rules as a reminder in a compact format. It reads:




                                                     75
W: 1d6@E+T

This should be read as “Weather: Roll 1d6 skewed by the Environment value, then add the Type offset”.




                                                   76
Monster
Similar to the Weather, Monster encounters are tuned to your current environment, or biome. Each
environment comes straight from D&D 5e, and the encounters that get generated will always consist of
monsters that can be found in that biome.

This column is simply a formula that you apply to a 1d6. Use the row that matches your current
environment.

For example, if we are in a Cavern, we look at row 3 and get “+1@-“ in the Monster column. This means
we will be rolling “1d6@Disadvantage +1” on the next table.

Note that you do this same thing if you happen to roll Natural Hazard -> Creature Tracks. To determine
what kind of Creature Tracks you see, you find your current Environment row and move over to the
Monster column to get the dice formula you need.

Yes, I admit it is a bit clunky, but I really like having monster encounters that fit the current biome. It just
feels more realistic.




                                                      77
Encounter Generator
Ok, so now that you have a Monster dice formula from above, roll the dice to get your row on the
Monster Encounter table.

Back to the Cavern example, we had “1d6@Disadvantage +1”. I rolled 2d6 and got [5,6], so I take the 5
(disadvantage) and add 1 to get 6. Row 6 on the table is Kobolds.

Lets pretend that when I rolled 2d6, I got doubles [6,6]. Doubles are a special case, you use the bottom
“**” row: Bandits. No matter which biome you are in, you have a chance of running into bandits.

But what about that little “*” next to row 6? Well, this is a second special case. See the “*” next to Forest on
the Environment table? If you are in the Forest, and you roll a 6 for Monster, then instead of Kobolds you
use the Blights in the “*” row. Blights are extremely common in the forest, but won’t appear in any other
biome.

Now that you know the row and the type of monster group you will be encountering, it is time to
determine the difficulty of the encounter.

> If you were rolling for Creature Tracks, you are done. In the Cavern example, you see Kobold tracks.

Roll 2d10. You only need the first number, but you also want to know if you rolled doubles.
The number on the first die determines the difficulty of the encounter. Once you know the difficulty, you will
use that column AND every column to the left.

For example, our Kobolds. If we rolled 2d10 and got [5,3], we didn’t get doubles so discard the 3. 5 means
“Medium” difficulty, so now we know that the encounter will consist of:

- Winged Kobold (Column 3)
- Giant Weasel (Column 2)
- Kobold (Column 1)

If we had rolled doubles, we would also add 1 boss monster to the encounter. In this case, that would be a
Young Dragon.

Now, how many of each monster is in the encounter? For each monster, roll “1d6-1” at either [“Advantage”,
“Straight”, “Disadvantage”] depending on the symbol next to that monster [“+”, “ “, “-“].

Winged Kobolds have a “+”, so roll “1d6@Advantage -1”. I rolled [5,2], so I use the 2, then subtract 1.
There will be 1 Winged Kobold.

Giant Weasels have a “+”, so roll “1d6@Advantage -1” again. I rolled [1,4], so take the 1 and subtract 1.
There won’t be any Giant Weasels.

Do the same for Kobolds. [4,2] -> 2-1 -> 1 Kobold.




                                                      78
My encounter in the Cavern is:

- 1 Winged Kobold
- 1 Kobold

Thats not bad, I can take them.

—

Lets do another example. We are in the Dark Swamp. The “Dark” doesn’t actually matter for the Monster
Encounter. Row 7 gives us “+3@+”, so lets roll “1d6@Advantage +3”. I got [4,2] -> 4 +3 = 7.

This means my Swamp encounter will be Lizardfolk.

Next, we roll for the difficulty. 2d10 -> [7,7] means a Medium encounter with a Boss.

We know there will be 1 Lizard King, but what about the rest?

- 1d6-1 Lizard Shaman -> [4,2] -> 4-1 -> 3
- 1d6-1 Giant Lizard -> [2,3] -> 2-1 -> 1
- 1d6-1 Lizardfolk -> [1,5] -> 1-1 -> 0

So the encounter is:

- 1 Lizard King
- 1 Giant Lizard
- 3 Lizard Shaman

I imagine the King is riding on the Giant Lizard.

—

One more. We are in the Arid Desert. Row 0 means “+4@4”. Rolling “1d6@Advantage +4”, I get [5,5].
Doubles! This will be a Bandit encounter.

Rolling 2d10 for difficulty: [1,9] -> Easy, no boss.

- 1d6-1 Thug -> [3,3] -> 3-1 -> 2 Thugs
- 1d6@Adv-1 Bandit -> [3,4] -> 4-1 -> 3 Bandits

Encounter:

- 2 Thugs
- 3 Bandits

Now, not every encounter necessarily means combat. Maybe you see these bandits in the distance and can
avoid them. Maybe you watch them to see where they are going or what they are doing. Maybe they are
cooking food, maybe they are already battling someone else. Or maybe they are injured from a previous
battle and could use a medic.

Don’t just immediately jump to combat (unless that is your jam, you do you), use this as an opportunity to
roleplay or do social checks. Or, stake them out and see if you can gain information on your objective.

You might also size up the opponent first. 5 vs 1 might be too much to handle, so you lay back, parley, or
run. But if you were in a party of 4? They don’t stand a chance.



Table

Below is the expanded Monster Encounter table. Every monster comes straight out of the D&D 5e Monster
Manual. I had to abbreviate a lot of the names to fit in such a small place, so use this if you can’t figure out
the abbreviation.

Each row is designed to fit the theme, be composed on monsters that generally associate with each other,
and be composed of archetypes that complement each other tactically. The goal was to have a single table
that could produce a variety of interesting results and tactical options, while still feeling natural and
realistic.

The dice formulas for each encounter were tuned for the following parties:

- Easy: Hard for 4 characters at level 2, 2 characters at level 4, or 1 character at level 5
- Medium: Hard for 3 characters at level 5, 2 characters at level 7, or 1 character at level 10
- Hard: Hard for 4 characters at level 5, 2 characters at level 8, or 1 character at level 12
- Hard w/ Boss: Hard for 4 characters at level 8, 3 characters at level 10, or 2 characters at level 12

“Difficulty” was determined using the Lazy Encounter Benchmark and Monte Carlo simulations: https://
slyflourish.com/the_lazy_encounter_benchmark.html

The Lazy Encounter Benchmark is written in a compact form in the header.

All chosen monsters are CR 5 or less. Encounters are designed for a max of 4 characters (but leaning
towards 2 characters, the PC and a sidekick), with a max level of 12.

Creature Tracks

You spot tracks made by a creature. Roll on the “Tracks” column of the Wilderness Monster Encounter
table to determine what kind of tracks you see.

> Remember, you need to start at your Environment, use that to obtain the modified d6 roll from the
Monster column, and use THAT to roll on the Tracks column. Refer to the Wilderness Monster Encounter
tables above for more information on how this works.


Dust Storm

Could be a sandstorm, could be dust from an explosion, could be smoke from a wildfire.


Flood

There is water everywhere!


Fog

It is extremely difficult to see in this thick fog…




                                                      82
Rockslide

Watch out for falling rocks!


Unstable Ground

This could be as benign as sand, thin ice, or a pit trap.


Crevice

The ground has split, and it is a long way to the other side…


Escarpment

You come across a steep cliff. It looks difficult to climb.


River Crossing

And no bridge in sight. How will you get across?


Thick Plants

The dense brush will slow you down, and the thorns will snag your pack.

Bones

The bones of a creature. Could be old, could be fresh, could be an ancient leviathan.


Cairn

A man-made stack of rocks intended to mark something.


Chasm

A deep hole in the ground. I wonder what is down there?


Circle

Could be a magic glyph, could be Stonehenge, could be a circle of mushrooms in a forest.


Spring

The water fountain kind. Could be a literal fountain, could be a hot spring, could be an oasis in the desert.


Grave

Anything from a tombstone, to a loose pile of dirt, a cross made of sticks, or just a dead body.


Monument


                                                     84
A statue, obelisk, plaque, etc.


Tower

Maybe it is a natural stalagmite, maybe it is a wizard-made tower. Or maybe it is a lighthouse?


Tree

Could be a massive tall tree in the middle of a forest. Or an out of place tree in the middle of nowhere.
Maybe it is unique somehow, like a cherry blossom.


Well

A deep hole in the ground. It could be dry, it could be a source of water, it could be the entrance to a
tunnel below.

dungeon. Use the theme to guide your expectations for what is inside.

Inside 2
This page is geared towards NPC creation, NPC actions, and NPC Dialog.




NPC
NPCs make your world feel alive, and these tables will help you make one quickly.

When making a new NPC, give them a Personality, a Need, a Motive, and a Name. You will also want to
assign them either an Active Disposition or a Passive Disposition. More on this later.




                                                   87
Personality
This table has the 10 OCEAN personality traits. In general, I like to roll 2 traits as their primary and
secondary qualities.

Motive / Topic
All NPCs have something they are motivated by. Use this table to determine what that is.

This table doubles as a conversation topic if your NPC is talking.

Action
Your NPCs will act on their own, and this table will guide you to help make their actions seem realistic.

This is a powerful table, so try to understand how it works.

                         Skew                                                 Context
                    Disadvantage                                               Passive
                      Advantage                                                 Active

This table is carefully arranged to be used with either a d6 or a d10, and to be rolled using either
advantage or disadvantage. Here is how it works:

The NPC that is acting will either have a Passive Disposition, or an Active Disposition. This was set at NPC
creation time and does not change. However, in the current context, they might have an Active role or a
Passive role in how they are participating. This can be changed using social checks from your system’s
rules.

Any NPC with a Passive Disposition will roll on the Action table using a d6. If they are actively participating
in the context, they will roll with Advantage. Such an NPC will have actions that gravitate towards the “Gives
Something” result. I like to use this for NPCs that are specifically designed to help the PC out, such as a
friendly merchant.


Social Checks

The NPC’s Disposition is static, but their participation in the context can be changed by passing a social
check. For example, if you were dealing with an Active/Active NPC at a tavern who is all riled up about


                                                      91
something, and you were afraid that a fight was about to break out, you could do a Persuasion Check to
try and calm them down. Passing the check means you have the option to change their Context from Active
to Passive before rolling their Action. In this case, if you passed your Persuasion Check to calm them down,
their next Action would be to roll the 1d10 at disadvantage, which means it is much less likely that they will
enter combat.

If during your social check, you score a Critical Hit / “Strong Hit”, you can change the skew of the roll AND
you get to choose to add or subtract 1 after making the roll. This essentially gives you the choice between
3 outcomes as a reward for your crit.

For example, if trying to calm down the above Active/Active NPC was a critical success, you could roll 2d10,
take the lower value, then add or subtract 1 depending on the result you are aiming for.

I rolled 8 and 10, so 8 is the lower result. This would normally mean that the NPC would act in their own
interests, but since I had a critical success I am going to nudge that down 1 to the result “End Encounter”.
My attempt at persuading the riled up patron to calm down worked, and they walk away.


Heading

The Heading of the NPC table has these rules compactly coded for reference. It reads:

Disp: d 10A/6P; Ctx: @+A/-P; WH: Delta CTX, SH: Delta CTX & +/- 1

This is intended to be read as:

Disposition: d10 for Active, d6 for Passive
Context: Roll with Advantage for Active, Disadvantage for Passive
Weak Hit: Change Context (Active -> Passive or Passive -> Active)
Strong Hit: Change Context, AND add or subtract 1 from the roll


Ambiguous Action

The NPC does something ambiguous. I usually like to think of this as a subtle action like a sigh, rolling their
eyes, a snort, glancing out of the corner of their eye, etc. Something that your character might notice, but it
isn’t clear what it means yet.


Talks

The NPC talks about something. Use the Topic table to determine what.


Continues

Whatever they were doing last, they continue to do.


Act: PC Interest



                                                      92
They act in the interest of your PC, trying to help you out in some way, or at least remain engaged, such as
a negotiation in your favor.


Next Most Logical

They are changing their action to the next most logical thing to do depending on the situation and context.


Gives Something

The NPC wants to give you something. It might be an item, it might be information, or it could be a hard
time.


End Encounter

The NPC wants to stop. They might be done talking, they might walk away, or retreat from combat.


Act: Self Interest

They act in their own interest. Perhaps they deny your request, maybe they pursue their need, or the
negotiation is tilted in their favor.


Takes Something

The NPC asks for something politely, or attempts to take it by force. Again, could be an item / cash /
information, but get creative. Maybe they take the first shot.


Enters Combat

The NPC is itching for a fight. Could be a fight with you, could be a fight with a nearby monster. It could be
“social combat”, such as a debate. It could be “friendly combat”, such as a challenge to an arm wrestling
match, or a game of cards.




                                                     93
Combat
Specifically for combat, you might want to know how an NPC will behave. Maybe you want to know what
your ally is doing, or how the enemy will respond. The Combat table can cover these cases.

Similar to the Action table, the die size and skew are important for achieving dynamic behaviors.

In combat, NPCs can be Passive or Active, and Offensive or Defensive. This is not static, and may change
throughout the course of the battle.

Passive actions are geared towards the NPC trying to look out for itself. The actions in the first 6 rows are
all designed to act as warnings or ways to improve their position.

Imagine you stumble upon a creature protecting its nest. It likely will start off Passive and Defensive,
meaning you roll its action or reaction using a d6 at disadvantage. However, if you continue to provoke the
creature, it may shift to Active and Defensive, which opens up opportunities for it to strike.

Or maybe you are in a cavern full of Kobolds. They might start out Passive and Offensive, in which their
actions gravitate towards moving to advantageous positions and coordinating amongst themselves. When
they are ready, they may switch to Active and Offensive, in which they will use their prebuilt advantages and
coordination to strike with precision and power.

An Offensive NPC may switch to Defensive if they are trying to retreat.



                                                     94
In other words, the shifting between Active/Passive and Offensive/Defensive allows the NPCs to behave
tactically and dynamically in combat, which keeps things exciting.
Defend

The NPC is defending, blocking, shielding, retreating, etc.
Shift Focus

The NPC is trying to shift your focus. Either to cause a distraction like a smoke bomb, or draw attention to
itself so you don’t see something more valuable. This could also be an attempt to parley.
Seize

The NPC is trying to obtain something. It may try to get to the treasure before you, it might take someone
hostage, or maybe it cuts off your path (locks the door, raises the bridge, etc)
Intimidate

The NPC is trying to scare you off or make you surrender. A monster might show its fangs or roar. A
group of bandits may brandish their weapons. The guards may surround you with sheer numbers.
Advantage

The NPC will do what it takes to get to a more advantageous position. The high ground, take cover, or
hide and prepare their next attack.
Coordinate

The NPC will attempt to coordinate with allies or call for backup.
Lure

The NPC may try to guide you into a trap, lure you out of hiding, or taunt/provoke you into rushing in.
Destroy

The NPC will try destroying something in the environment. Cut the rope of a bridge, smash that support
pillar, make the chandelier drop, or toss a boulder your way.
Precision

The NPC will strike fast, using agility and precision, aiming for a weak point. An assassination attempt, or a
hit and run technique.
Power

The NPC will strike strong and hard, using brute force and relentless fury.




                                                     95
Dialog
The NPC Dialog grid is like a mini-game to generate a conversation, or at least guide it. I will admit, it is a
bit slow (which is why there are alternative topic and response tables available) but it can be a fun way to
naturally evolve a conversation.

The grid itself is a bit too complex to reproduce here, so I will have to refer you to the actual pocketfold.


How it works

The Dialog Grid is similar to a hex flower (a square flower?) in that you maintain the state throughout the
conversation. The dice will have you move around the grid as the conversation progresses, which will
prompt you for the type of response that the NPC gives.

The grid is for the NPC responses; you still choose what your PC says. Therefore, the grid is reactionary.
You CAN use it to have two NPCs talk to each other, but it can get tricky.

Start at the center of the grid, on “Fact”. If the NPC is initiating the conversation, they will state a fact to
your PC. It could be as simple as “I need to talk to you”. If your PC is initiating the conversation, skip this
step.

First, roll 2d10. The first number chooses the direction to move on the grid, as well as the tone that the
NPC will take. The second number selects the subject that the NPC is referring to. Remember that it will be
from the NPC’s perspective. If at any time these two dice are the same number, that means the
conversation is ending. If you get to an edge, you wrap around to the opposite edge. The state persists as
long as the conversation is going, you use a single marker regardless of how many NPCs are participating,
and you always reset to the center “Fact” whenever a new conversation is started.

The top two rows are in italics. This indicates that the dialog fragment is about the past. The bottom three
rows are dialog fragments about the present.

As you generate the conversation, keep in mind the NPC’s personality, needs, motives, and disposition.
Use this as part of the context to figure out what they might be talking about.

A few examples might help.



Example 1

Our PC has just arrived in town. A guard approaches.

“Fact” -> “You there! I haven’t seen you around before.”

PC: “Yes, hello, I have just arrived in town and am looking for an Inn to spend the night. Are you able to
recommend one?”



                                                      96
2d10 -> 3,0: Move left to “Need”, take a “Defensive” tone with the subject of “Us” (from the perspective of
the NPC)

NPC: “I’m sorry, we aren’t supposed to show favoritism towards any one establishment.”

PC: “Ah, I understand. In that case, can you point me towards the closest tavern?”

2d10 -> 6,1: Move right to “Fact”, take an “Aggressive” tone with the subject of “Them”.

NPC: “There is a tavern just down that alley to the right… But you better not be looking to stir up some
trouble, we just dealt with a rowdy group not even a half hour ago.”

PC: “Nope, no trouble here!”

2d10 -> 8,2: Move right to “Action”, take an “Aggressive” tone with the subject of “Them”.

NPC: “Good to hear, I’d hate to have to throw you in jail with the rest of them.”

PC: “What were they doing?”

2d10 -> 7,4: Move right to “Denial”, take an “Aggressive” tone with the subject of “Me” (again, from the
perspective of the NPC)

NPC: “That is none of your business.”

PC: “Understood, thank you, I will be on my way”

—

Ok, so I honestly just generated that on the fly without any fudged rolls. I had originally imagined that my
PC would have entered town, gotten some help from the friendly local guard, and been directed to an Inn.
However, by generating the conversation like this, I now have a much different vibe about this town; The
guard was generally unhelpful and aggressive, the conversation itself seems a bit tense, and it almost feels
a bit shady or unsafe. I may even have a lead for a sidequest. Now I have a completely different vision of
this town, just from this first interaction, and I can use that expectation as part of the context for future
checks.


Example 2

This time, our PC is negotiating with a merchant for a discount on an item.

PC: “I’m interested in this sword, but I’m pretty low on funds. Any chance you could give me a discount?”

2d10 -> 9,3: Move down from “Fact” to “Denial”, take a helpful tone with the subject of “Me”

NPC: “Ah, yes that is a very quality sword, you have sharp eyes! I’m sorry, but I cannot go lower than the
listed price.”


                                                     97
> Me as a player am curious as to why not. Lets try a “Topic” roll: 1d10 -> 6: Superiors

NPC: “You see, my father is the blacksmith that made that sword. He put a lot of effort into it, and priced it
accordingly. He’d get pretty mad at me if I let it go for less…”

PC: “Hmm, well, does your father need any help obtaining any supplies?”

2d10 -> 3,8: Move left to “Query” with a Defensive tone and a subject of “You”.

NPC: “I am not sure, but I can go ask, he is in the back. Will you wait here?”

PC: “Of course”

> Lets do a Fate Check to see what the blacksmith says. I think it is likely.
> I rolled “+ 0 4” meaning “Moderate Yes”

NPC: “Yes, actually he says he is running low on <insert some item here>. He said if you were to obtain
some of these, he could give you a 10% discount on the sword”

PC: “Great! Its a deal!”

—

So here is a case where I could have just done a Fate Check on “Can I get a discount?” or “Does he need
supplies?”, but instead I chose to do it via Dialog. When I got stuck, I supplemented the conversation with a
Topic, and used it as an opportunity to receive a sidequest.

This example hopefully highlights how the different tools, tables, and checks can be used in a bit of a free-
flow style to make the mini-game of social interaction more fun than just boiling it down to a series of Fate
Checks.

In fact, I could have chosen to have the Blacksmith come to the front and join the conversation instead, if I
wanted to keep the conversation going longer. Lets play out that example:


Example 3

NPC: “I am not sure, but I can go ask, he is in the back. Will you wait here?”

PC: “Of course”

A moment later, the blacksmith and his son return.

2d10 -> 5,4: Move left from “Query” to “Need”, with a Defensive tone and a subject of “Me”

Blacksmith: “I understand you want to help get some materials for me? In fact, I am looking for more
<insert some item here>, however I am very particular about the quality.”




                                                       98
PC: “If you can give me a description of the item and where to find it, I will do my best”

2d10 -> 4,9: Move left from “Need”, wrap around to the right edge at “Want”, with a Defensive tone and a
subject of “Us”.

Blacksmith: “Well, I would feel more comfortable if my son accompanied you instead. He knows how to
pick the best <insert item here>. Luckily it isn’t too far away.”

2d10 -> 0,2: Move down to “Need” with Helpful tone and a subject of “Them”.

Son: “(To his father) If that is what you need, I’m happy to help. (Turning to the PC) Well, when you are
ready, you can follow me”

—

Here we played out the conversation from before a bit longer, turning it into a 3-way conversation with
two NPCs, getting a side quest AND a temporary ally out of it that can assist with checks and possible
combat, but also someone I need to protect during the quest.

Establishment
If you come across a settlement, you will want to populate it with some significant establishments.

I generally classify settlements as “villages” or “cities”, where villages are smaller and more rural, and cities
are larger and more urban. As such, there are more types of establishments available in a city than a
village, determined using the die size.

When building a village, first roll 1d6 at disadvantage. That is how many establishments the village should
have. For each establishment, roll 1d6 on the table to determine what it is. If you get multiples of one type,
make them distinct from each other somehow. For example, if you get two taverns, maybe they are rivals
trying to brew the best ale, or maybe one is a front for the thieves guild.

When building a city, first roll 1d6 at advantage. That is how many establishments the city should have. For
each establishment, roll 1d10 on the table to determine what it is. Cities have more quantity and variation
for their shops.

Dungeon Generator
This is a simple, dynamic dungeon generator in which you generate it as you explore, room by room.
Alternatively, you can use it to pregenerate a map and explore it after the fact.


Heading

The heading encodes the basic rules in a compact format. It reads:

NA: 1d10@- Until Doubles, Then NA: 1d10@+

This means, any time you are generating the Next Area, you roll 1d10 with Disdvantage on the Next Area
table and use that result. However, once you get doubles, from that point on you always roll 1d10 with
Advantage on the Next Area table.

I have more details about this procedure later on in the document.

Passage

The next area is a passage. Roll on the Passage table. This is like a hallway to somewhere else.


Chamber

The next area is a chamber with some number of doors (including the door you just walked through; 1
door means dead end!). For large chambers, you can roll on the Encounter table twice.


Locked Door

You are going to need a key to get through.

You can use your system’s rules to attempt to bypass locks via checks or magic; I usually roll DCs with
disadvantage in this case, in order to incentivize finding the key.

Alternatively, this can represent a path that is blocked for some reason, such as fallen rocks.


Known / Expected

If you had something on your “Known” list / index card, roll or choose it and cross it off. Otherwise, just
imagine what you would have expected this room to be, based on what you have seen up to this point.




                                                     112
Exit / Stairs

You found an exit! Or possibly stairs to a deeper level.


Connection to Previous Area

Instead of this being a new area, the path connects to an area you have previously found. Hook it to an
unexplored door, or add a secret door that was undiscovered.

It might also be the other side of a locked door, in which case the door can be opened from this side
without the key.




                                                     113
Passage
Passages connect Areas, like “nodes” and “edges” in a graph. You can tune your dungeon shape and size
by selecting the die size and skew on this table.

Narrow Crawlspace

You can crawl through this tunnel, but its risky.

This passage is abnormally long.
Wide

This passage is abnormally wide.

A normal passage connecting two areas.

Side Passage

Like a T-shape, but one that juts off to the side. It could just be a small pocket alcove, or another area.
3-Way Intersection

Fork in the road. I like to do Immersion Checks in both directions to see which way to go.
4-Way Intersection

A crossroad, so many options!

Condition
As you explore, different rooms will be in different conditions. You can use the theme you generated for
the dungeon to determine what die size and skew you should be using.

                        Roll                                             Condition

You don’t need to roll a condition for each room individually, sometimes it makes more sense to roll a
condition every few areas and apply that condition to the group. For example, if you come across a
flooded area in a cavern, it wouldn’t be unlikely that adjacent areas are also flooded.




                                                  116
Dungeon Encounter
Each time you enter a new Area or Passage, you roll a d10 on the Dungeon Encounter table to see what
you come across. If you are lingering in a non-Safety area for more than 10 minutes, roll on the Encounter
table again, this time with a d6.

Heading

The heading says:
10m 1d6 (NH: d6); Trap: 10m AP@+ A/L, PP L/T

This is a compact shorthand for “Every 10 minutes, roll another encounter using 1d6 (if you get Natural
Hazard, use 1d6 on that table).”

For traps, there is more information on the Trap section later in this document, but the header says: “You
can spend 10 minutes to do an Active Perception check with advantage. Pass: Avoid, Fail: Locate.
Otherwise, do a Passive Perception check. Pass: Locate, Fail: Trigger”

Avoid: You find the trap and can completely avoid it, no issues.
Locate: You find the trap, but must do something to disarm or bypass it.
Trigger: You trigger the trap and must suffer the consequences.




                                                   117
Monster

There is a monster in this room. Use the Dungeon Monster table to describe it.


Natural Hazard

Some other hazard is in this room, use the same Natural Hazard table that is over on the Wilderness page.
If this is your first time entering the room, roll a 1d10 on the Natural Hazard table. If you have been
lingering more than 10 minutes in this area and get this result, roll a 1d6 on the Natural Hazard table.


Challenge

You need to pass a Challenge. Perform the Challenge procedure, and Pay The Price if you fail.


Immersion

Perform an Immersion check to add some flavor to your exploration.


Safety

This place is safe! You can take time to camp, eat, etc. You do not need to roll another encounter every 10
minutes in a safe area.


Known

Roll on your Known list, what ever you get is in this room. Cross it off. If your Known list is empty, there is
nothing in this room.


Trap

There is a trap in this room. Go to the Trap section of this document to learn more about how to handle
traps.


Feature

You found a unique feature of this dungeon. Roll on the Dungeon Feature table.


Key

You found a key! This is like a Zelda key, in that it can open any locked door in this dungeon. Once you
have used it, it is gone.


Treasure



                                                     118

abstract. You will roll once on each table, then imagine the monster it might represent.

There is a detailed Trap procedure later in this document that explains how to handle Traps when solo
roleplaying.

Feature
Every now and then you will come across a unique feature that sets this area apart from the others.

                        Roll                                                Feature
                          1                                                 Library

There is something special about this feature. It is important somehow, or perhaps out of place.




                                                   122
Location
The location grid is one of those tools that really isn’t necessary, yet comes in handy often enough that I
like to include it.

The grid itself is 5x5, colored like a bullseye. With a 1d100, each cell has the same probability of being
rolled.

The grid can be used two different ways.


Compass Method

First, imagine your PC being in the center of the bullseye. When you want to know where something is, such
as the next closest town, roll 1d100. You will get both a direction (such as North East) and a distance
(Close or Far) depending on which ring you land on.

It is abstract, but it can be used to populate your hex map, determine how many travel days are needed,
determine which direction the road goes, etc.


Zoom Method

The other way to use the location grid is via iterative zooming. Pretend that the grid is an overlay for your
world map. Roll 1d100, and “zoom” into the region you land on.

Now, pretend that the grid is an overlay for that regional map. Roll and zoom into a particular section of
that region (maybe a settlement?).

Then, imagine that settlement map with the grid overlay. Roll to select a specific building.

You can keep going as long as you want until you have an answer to whatever you are looking for.

I sometimes use this for Remote Events that I roll on the Random Event table, to determine where that
Remote Event occurs. I have also done this for “hiding” the legendary treasure somewhere in the world
that the PC needs to get to. It works better if you are using a pregenerated map instead of building your
own map as you explore.




                                                     123
Left Extension
NPCs make the world feel alive. Talking with them can help you world-build, give you side quests, or give
information that your character would otherwise not have access to.

But lets be real: The Dialog Grid mini game can be slow and tedious. This extension page provides an
alternative set of tables with all sorts of NPC Topics, Statements, and Responses.



Information
Roll 2d100 to determine what an NPC is talking about. It might be a response to you asking them for
information, or it might be something you overheard them talking about from the next table over.



Companion Response
Chances are, your character has a companion traveling when them. This table has simple responses to “the
plan”. It is roughly ordered such that bigger numbers are more in favor with “the plan”, and smaller
numbers are more opposed to “the plan”, so you can roll with Advantage / Disadvantage as necessary.



Dialog Topic
Have I mentioned that talking with NPCs makes the world feel alive? But what are they talking about?

This table has more topics than the standard one. It can also be used for News, the contents of letters,
books, writing on walls, etc.




                                                   124
Right Extension
Flip the right “wing” up to reveal a half page of abstract icons! This is for those who like pictures instead of
words.



Abstract Icons
Roll 1d10 + 1d6 to pick an icon. These selections were inspired by Rory’s Story Cubes.




                                                      125
Common Tasks
Now that we have discussed the tables individually, it is time to talk about how they can be used together
during play.



Sandbox Play
A decent template for sandbox play is to start from a relatively blank state, then define some basic truths
for your world. You don’t need a ton of detail here; most of the worldbuilding will happen naturally as you
play.

Then, draw a single hex and place a settlement in the center. This will be your starting point. Generate the
Type/Environment of this hex, as that will have a direct effect on the settlement.

Give your settlement some establishments, then generate some NPCs and talk to a few. You are just
looking for a few different sidequests to kickstart your adventure. Once you have 3 sidequests to pick
from, choose your favorites and set out.

As you go through the above process, you will start to slowly build your world through the questions you
ask and the details you generate. What may start off as a few unrelated sidequests may morph into
something larger.

From the settlement, you will begin exploring the wilderness around you. Through your exploration, you
may find more settlements, or you may find dungeons. Exploring dungeons can net you experience and
treasure.

Throughout this process, you will face challenges that will require your skills to overcome. The Challenge
procedure can be used to create scenes for you to interact in, and consequences should you fail.

Sandbox play can be harsh, especially if you are wandering around aimlessly. Try to use those first couple
sidequests to establish relationships with the NPCs that may lead to larger mainline quests. Having a solid
objective can help you progress your story forward, building the world around you along the way.




                                                    126
Region Creation / Exploration
If you follow the above template, you will be starting out in a settlement located in a specific type of
environment (such as the Snowy Mountains). As you explore outwards, you will traverse from hex to hex,
dealing with whatever encounter you find along the way.

As you enter a new hex, roll 2dF and make that jump from your current environment. Then roll 1dF to
select the type relative to that new environment. Finally, roll on the Encounter table to see what you
encounter in this hex.

The Encounter table will prompt you to deal with obstacles, fight monsters, handle the changing weather,
etc. It will also present you with opportunities to find new settlements, explore dungeons, or simply
advance your story forward.




                                                  127
Settlement Creation
Whenever you arrive at a new settlement, you should take note of the type of environment it is in. This
should have a direct effect on how the inhabitants of the settlement live their lives. Roll a name for the
settlement, and envision how this place may have gotten that name. Then, roll two properties, such as
“Major Style” and “Minimal Weight”. Use these to help you get a better idea of what this settlement might
look like.

Decide if this place is a “village” or a “city”. You can use a Fate or Expectation check to decide for you if
you wish. For villages, roll 1d6 at disadvantage to determine how many establishments to make. Cities use
1d6 at advantage.

Once you know how many establishments to make, roll them up. You will use a d6 for villages and a d10
for cities.

You will then want to name each establishment. One trick I like to do is use “Color” + “Object”. This will do
a few things:

- Each establishment has a (hopefully distinct) color to help you mark it on a map.
- Each establishment has an object they use as their emblem on the storefront sign.
- The color/object pairing can also give some hints as to the theme of that establishment.

For example, a tavern may get the name “The Crimson Hourglass”. Sorta gives the vibe of your life force
draining away, which could be due to this place being a bit sketchy, like a drug den or brothel.

Or maybe a stable gets the name “The Violet Claw”. Makes me wonder if instead of horses, they have giant
ravens?

For each establishment, generate a simple NPC as the owner. You may want a few additional NPCs for
places like a tavern.

Finally, generate some News that you might hear throughout your visit to the settlement, something that
the NPCs might be talking about. This can give you hooks for quests, and you can chat with NPCs to get
more details.




                                                    128
NPC Creation
I wanted to be able to generate NPCs quickly, so it should only take a few steps. First is to give them a
name. Next, given them a Personality, Need, and Motive.

Example Simple NPC:

1d20 on the Name Pattern table: 5 -> “23-“ -> 11,1 -> “Rondan”
This has a masculine sound to me.

3d10 on Personality, Need, Motive: 0,2,9 -> “Sensitive, Shelter, Treasure”

Rondan is a kind, perhaps shy character, who has wanderlust and desires adventure and treasure, but is
too scared to leave his home and set out.

For a more complex NPC, such as one that you would keep with you as a sidekick, roll a color and two
properties. You can optionally give them a secondary personality trait. You can also do this for any simple
NPC that you want to “flush out” a bit more.

I also tend to roll the Need with advantage for people NPCs, and disadvantage for Monsters.

Example Complex NPC:

1d20 on the Name Pattern table: 2 -> “12” -> 6,4 -> “Demor”

2d10 on the Personality table: 9,5 -> “Confident, yet Reserved”
1d10 @ Advantage for Need: 9 -> “Recognition”
1d10 Motive: 7 -> “Wealth”

1d10 Color: 3 -> “Highlight Yellow”
1d10 + 1d6 Property: 5,3 -> “Mundane Quality”
1d10 + 1d6 Property: 0,1 -> “Minimal Weight”

Demor is someone with high self esteem who always sees the best in people, and yearns for people to
someday see the best in them as well. They are trying to earn money. Demor has average looks and is
pretty thin.

During a conversation with this NPC, they might bring up that they are trying to earn some money, which
could lead to the PC hiring them to do something. Discover Meaning or the extended NPC tables could
reveal what they need the money for, which could lead to a sidequest.




                                                    129
Quest Creation
Whether it be a quest from a job board or a rumor heard at the tavern, you will be using the Quest table
to generate a sentence, then interpret it to turn it into a quest. Likely, you will need to ask a few questions
to ascertain the details of the quest, and you can do this either out-of-character using Fate questions, or
in-character by talking to NPCs.

Roll up a quest using 5d10. Many of the tables reference other tables, so you will be rolling a few more
dice to get all the results.

5d10 -> 3,8,1,4,0 -> “Deliver Mystical Enemy Near Wilderness Feature”
1d10 on Wilderness Feature -> 3 -> “Chasm”

This could be interpreted as “You need to deliver something to the mystical enemy near the chasm”, but it
could also be “You need to deliver the mystical enemy to the chasm”.

I expect it is the first, lets test it.
Expectation Test: “+ 0” -> Expected
Ok, so what do we need to deliver?
Detail Check: 5 -> History -> 3 -> Something from a previous Thread

Think of some object (or person!) from a previous thread that a mystical enemy near the chasm might
want. Then, try to come up with a reason why. You now have a quest, and potentially a new thread.

Of course, you don’t need to follow the quest exactly as written. Lets say this all happened because you
received a letter from the dark wizards demanding you bring them the magic stone you acquired in the
past, or they will murder your family. That could be one interpretation of the quest you generated, but
maybe the Thread you start and follow is more along the lines of “defeat the dark wizards” or “get your
family to safety”, because you can’t let that stone fall into the wrong hands. Or, maybe you already gave
the stone to the authorities, and now you need to do a heist mission to retrieve it again.

In other words, the Thread that spawns from generating a quest doesn’t necessarily need to be the
prompted quest itself.




                                                     130
Dungeon Creation / Exploration
When you first discover a dungeon, you roll on the Dungeon Name table. This sets the general theme of
the dungeon. You will incorporate that theme into the rest of the rolls.

There are a couple different ways to handle Dungeons: One-Pass and Two-Pass.



One-Pass
In the One-Pass style, you will be generating the dungeon on the fly. This is the way I like to play. As you
explore, you will be alternating between rolls on the Next Area table and on the Passage table, drawing
your map as you go. For each Area and Passage, you also roll on the Condition and Dungeon Encounter
tables to describe how that room looks and what is inside. The Encounter table fans out to multiple
different tables to generate a random and dynamic dungeon.

If you are exploring this dungeon because you KNOW something is inside of it somewhere, keep track of
that on a “Known” index card. If it is a room, it will eventually be a result from the Next Area table, and if it
is an object or monster, it will eventually be a result on the Encounter table. This allows you to eventually
reach your objective as you explore.

There is no “end” to the dungeon generation; as long as you keep exploring, it will keep generating new
places to explore. That said, the “disadvantage -> doubles -> advantage” mechanism will have the effect
of making the dungeon first feel like it is expanding, but later provide less options for exploration and
more options for leaving. Eventually, all the passages will either lead to dead ends, locked doors, or exits.

This is designed to mimic the “Skyrim” dungeon style, where you take the long way to your objective, but
once you reach your objective, there is a convenient shortcut that gets you back out quickly.

One other important note; I personally use “Zelda” style keys, where any key found in the dungeon can
unlock any locked door in that dungeon, but then that key is lost. This makes it much easier to keep track
of things. Note that it is entirely possible to come across more locked doors than there are keys, it all
depends on your Encounter rolls.



Two-Pass
The Two-Pass method is similar, but with a specific difference; You pregenerate the entire map before
doing any exploration.

That is, for the first pass you only use the “Next Area” / “Passage” / “Condition” tables; you do not use the
“Encounter” table. Doing this allows you to draw out the map of the dungeon by randomly generating it
rather quickly.




                                                      131
There is an additional rule: If you roll “doubles” a second time, then every unrevealed path immediately
becomes a “Small Chamber: 1 Door”. In other words, you will start by rolling 1d10 with Advantage, switch
to Disadvantage on the first set of Doubles, then stop generating the map on the second set of Doubles.

After you have a map, you begin the second pass. This is where you actually play it out, by traversing
through your map, rolling on the Encounter table each time you enter a new room. All the rest of the stuff
is the same.

One of the bonuses for this distinction is that you can skip the first pass and just do the second pass of the
Two-Pass method on ANY pregenerated map; it doesn’t have to be a Juice map. This essentially boils
down to skipping the entire “Dungeon Generator” set of tables and relying only on the “Dungeon
Encounter” tables.

Said another way, this is how you explore premade maps.




                                                     132
Challenge Procedure
In normal D&D 5e gameplay, the DM will present a scenario, the players will state their actions, the DM will
call for skill checks and describe the results. This loops around again.

In solo play, the concept is similar. As you explore the wilderness or dungeons, you will be prompted to
complete a Challenge. Think of it like a mini-game. The Challenge Procedure is a combination of 3 things:

1) A Mythic Scene
2) A D&D 5e style Skill Check
3) An Ironsworn style Move with a Pay The Price consequence

First, you will roll two Challenges: 1 Physical and 1 Mental. For each, you will roll a DC. If you are using D&D
5e you have your skill checks. For another system, try to map the challenge you rolled to the skills or stats
you have. You can use the DC value that was rolled as a general difficulty gauge, where 5 is easy and 20 is
hard.

Next, (this is the mini-game aspect), you need to take the two challenges you rolled, combine it with the
current context, and come up with a Scene or situation where these challenges make sense.

For example, if I rolled a difficult Athletics challenge, and an easy Investigation challenge, and I combine
that with the context of my character exploring a cavern, then perhaps I have arrived at some sort of gap
in the floor between me and the next area. The pit is a decent length, but there are clearly footprints on
both sides of the pit. It is possible that there is a hidden rope that can be used to get across.

Using the rolled challenges plus the current context, I came up with a scene where the two options make
sense.

Lets pretend my character was good at jumping. They could just try to go for it and attempt the jump with
an Athletics skill check and risk falling into the pit. Or, perhaps they take some time to do the Investigation
(which might take 10 minutes) to look for something to help them across. If they pass the Investigation
check, you could then do a Fate Check to see if there actually was a rope (likely).

Each challenge should invoke a skill check, have some sort of differentiation that affects the choice, and
have a consequence to failing.

Failing a check means you need to Pay The Price. Use your best judgment here, as sometimes choosing the
most logical result is better than rolling on the table. For example, failing the Investigation check would
mean you don’t find the rope (whether it is there or not), leaving you no other option but to try to make
the jump. However, if you had instead chosen to attempt the jump first, and fail, that means you probably
fell into the pit and are at the bottom, possibly injured. Being at the bottom of the pit means you don’t
really have the option of searching for the rope anymore.

In other words, your character will always have a choice between two paths forward, and they only need to
pass one challenge to progress. One challenge will require a physical trait and one will require a mental
trait. Failing one may lock out the other option, but not necessarily. The difficulty of the challenge indicates



                                                      133
the risk vs reward.




                      134
Trap Procedure
How to handle traps in solo play?

When you enter an area, before rolling on the Encounter table, decide if you are going to search the room
for traps. Once you decide, you must commit to this action.

Searching a room for traps takes 10 minutes. In fact, doing any sort of action in a room (such as looking
for secret doors, taking a break, eating a ration, investigating, etc) takes 10 minutes. This means in general
you can do one action per room without consequence. If you spend more than 10 minutes in a non-Safety
room you need to roll another encounter (this time with a d6). Therefore, lingering around in the dungeon
is dangerous. You can choose to search every room for traps, but this choice will either limit the number of
other actions you can take, or will increase your risk of stumbling upon trouble.

After you decide, roll on the Encounter table. If you chose to search and didn’t roll Trap, you spend your
10 minutes before dealing with the encounter you rolled (unless it is Monster; you can deal with the
monster first).

If you chose to search the room, roll a normal DC, then make a Perception Check with Advantage (or
whatever the equivalent is in your system). If you pass, you find and avoid/bypass the trap. If you fail, you
find the trap and do not trigger it, but you need to figure out how to bypass or disarm it. This is when you
roll on the Trap table, then use the appropriate checks to deal with it.

If you do not search the room, use your Passive Perception to make the check. If you pass, you find the
trap and do not trigger it, but you need to figure out how to bypass or disarm it. If you fail, you trigger the
trap and suffer the consequences. This is when you roll on the Trap table.

Here is a flowchart:




                                                     135
What about parties?

The above works regardless of party size. For parties (more than one character exploring the dungeon),
only one character needs to search for traps. All characters can do their single 10-minute action
simultaneously in parallel. But if any one character wants to do a second 10-minute action, then you will
need to roll on the encounter table again (using a 1d6 this time).

If no one in the party searches for traps, then you need to randomly roll to determine which party member
will perform the passive perception check. If they fail, it is that party member who triggers the trap. Roll on
the Trap table. Use your best judgment around who might be moving around the room to trigger a trap,
and who else might get caught in the trap as well.




                                                     136
Item Creation
The Object / Treasure table is the largest table in Juice, mainly because I wanted a way to be able to
generate a large variety of unique objects.

To create an item, first roll 4d6 on the Object / Treasure table. This will give you a decent starting
description of the object, but you will want to then roll two properties for it to flush it out even more.

For example:
4d6 -> 4,3,4,5 -> “Accessory: Simple Silver Necklace”
Property: 1d10+1d6 -> 9,5 -> Major Value
Property: 1d10+1d6 -> 5,4 -> Moderate Power

So at first glance, this appears to be a normal silver necklace, however it grants some sort of ability that
greatly increases its value.

Presumably the character would need to “identify” the necklace before it’s true nature is revealed, and
whether that power is actually a curse or not (Fate Check).

For some objects, you may also want to roll a color that describes how it looks, or maybe what elemental
powers it may have.




                                                    137
Examples
Now, I will provide two “Actual Play” examples that showcase Juice in action.

For the first example, I will be fudging some rolls in order to explicitly trigger certain tables, as a way to
demonstrate how each table and the procedures work.

For the second example, I will roll randomly and move forward with the results I get, unmodified (you will
just have to trust me), as a way to get a feel for how Juice truly behaves during play.

Just keep in mind that I am not a very good writer, so don’t judge me… The purpose of this section is to
showcase how Juice works, not necessarily to create an engaging story.

Oh, and if it seems like I am skipping out on details, it is because I do my best to only generate the
minimum of what I need to progress, and let the world (and the characters) flush itself out over time. For
example, conversations or interactions later on may end up filling in some of the blanks we left open.
Furthermore, it is perfectly okay to retcon and replace details with better ideas as they pop up. The idea is
to have fun; you don’t need to be 100% consistent.

Finally, the story / journal will be in this normal font.
My rolls and commentary will be in this italics font.




                                                            138
Forced
For this example, I am going to specifically railroad through the following steps, in order to hit each table
and demonstrate how the oracle as a whole works together:

- Character Creation
- Settlement Creation
- Quest Generation
- NPC Interaction
- Wilderness Exploration
- Dungeon Exploration

That is, we will start with a new PC in a settlement. They will stumble upon a quest and talk to an NPC to
get more information about the quest (which will be a fetch quest to retrieve an item from a dungeon).
They will then set off through the wilderness towards the dungeon, then traverse through the dungeon
itself until locating the treasure.

I will be using a D&D 5e 2014 character sheet, but with Ironsworn’s resolution system (as described near
the beginning of this document) so you can get a feel for how these two systems interact.

For the character, I will use “Human Fighter 1” from the pregenerated characters on D&D Beyond: https://
media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/marketing/character_sheets1_10.zip

This is a level 1 Fighter, with the following stats:

STR: +3
DEX: -1
CON: +2
INT: +1
WIS: +0
CHA: +2

And the following proficiencies:

- STR Save
- CON Save
- Athletics
- History
- Intimidation
- Perception

                                                       139
Character Creation
Lets give our Fighter a name: 16 -> “23-i” -> 11,6 -> Rondini.

Personality x2: 5,8 -> “Reserved and Compassionate”
Need: 2 -> “Shelter”
Motive: 6 -> “Superiors”
Color: 6 -> “Crimson Red”
Property: 1d10+1d6 -> 5,6 -> “Maximum Rarity”
Property: 1d10+1d6 -> 1,3 -> “Mundane Age”

I expect that her family is either dead or missing.
Expectation Check: “+ -“ -> Next Most Expected
So her family is missing somehow.

Rondini is a young orphan. Her eyes are a deep, blood red, a trait so rare that her parents assumed she
was cursed or a monster. They abandoned her at a young age out of fear.

She has struggled most of her life, generally keeping her guard up and slow to trust a stranger. However,
she does her best to show kindness to others in hopes that they can see past her eye color and the fear it
causes.

Rondini has joined the local military in order to have a place to live. In exchange, she follows her orders
diligently, lest she be cast back out to the street.




                                                      140
Settlement
Lets figure out where Rondini is right now.

Environment: 1d10 -> 1 -> Arctic
Type: 1dF -> “+” -> Rocky
Settlement Name: 2d10 -> 5,9 -> Ravenstone
Properties x2 (1d10+1d6) -> 6,4,7,1 -> Moderate Rarity, Minimal Size
Due to the size, Ravenstone is likely a village.
Number of Establishments: 1d6 @ Disadvantage: 3
3x Establishments (1d6):

- 6 -> “Artisan” -> 1d6 -> 1 -> “Artist”
- 1 -> “Stable”
- 2 -> “Tavern”

“What kind of artist are they?” -> “Discover Meaning” -> 1,4 -> “Ancient Control”
I’ll interpret this as someone who works with clay and pottery.

Name of the Potter: 1,5 -> “The Black Claw”
Name of the Stable: 5,7 -> “Cobalt Hourglass”
Name of the Tavern: 7,6 -> “Royal Hook”

And lastly, 1d10 on the News table: 6 -> Remote Event.
Ah, something is happening far away from here. I haven’t rolled a Random Event -> Remote Event yet, so
instead of referencing that, we will just need to make something up. I’ll use the location grid to get the general
location: 1d100 -> 61 -> Pretty far west, and slightly south.
“Is this location another settlement?” Fate Check: “- + 2” -> “No, But… (Minor)”.
So the event isn’t happening in a settlement, but perhaps just outside of one.
Lets name it: 2d10 -> 2,7 -> “Highrock”.
Finally, I’ll roll on the Event table to see what it was: 1d10 -> 7 -> Escape.

Sounds like someone may have escaped from jail in Highrock and fled the city. If the people of Ravenstone are
hearing about it, then this person must have been pretty high profile.

Lets see what the weather is like today. “Rocky Arctic” means rolling “1d6 at Disadvantage +2” -> 4 ->
“Thunder Storm”.

Rondini is staring down at her half full glass of ale, watching the condensation drip down the side. She
glances instinctively towards the window as a boom of thunder briefly covers up the familiar sound of rain
hitting the thatched roof.

Despite sitting at the same table as her three coworkers, she feels a bit out of place. The rest of them have
been chatting about something this whole time, but Rondini’s mind was somewhere else. She glances
around the candle-lit tavern and notes that it is less busy than usual.



                                                       141
“… Yea, I wonder if they are headed this way. We will need to stay alert” her coworker says. Rondini snaps
back to reality. “Who?” she asks. “Haven’t you been listening? <insert name here> has escaped from
prison! Those jokers in Highrock sure bungled that one…”

I need a name: 1d20 -> 17 -> “23+” -> 6,11 -> “Derond”. Discover Meaning: 11,1 -> “Artificial Burden”

“Wait, you don’t mean that guy with the metal arm, do you?” Rondini exclaimed. She had heard stories of a
man with a missing hand, who had attached a dagger in its place. He would hide the blade in his sleeve
and stab his victims from the shadows.

“But why would he come way out here to this frigid hellhole?” another coworker questioned. It was true,
not many folks visited Ravenstone. The winters were harsh, and even the locals had a tough time surviving.

The door to the tavern swings open.

Side note: Here, we have set the scene, we have introduced a possible thread that could be followed up on later,
and we are about to introduce a quest to kick off the adventure.




                                                      142
Quest
Ok, someone important is about to walk in with a quest. But before we determine who, lets generate the quest.
That might help indicate who the quest giver is.

5d10 -> 1,7,4,5,3 -> “Attain Hidden Environment On Top Of Dungeon”
Environment -> 8 -> Water
Dungeon: 3d10 -> 7,5,1 -> “Mine of Forbidden Blades”

Oh, wow, this one is a bit tricky. Maybe the town gets all its fresh water from this underground lake? But then,
does that mean the rainwater is somehow not safe?

Fate Check: “Is this underground lake the town’s source of water?” -> “> 0 4” -> “Invalid Assumption
(Moderate)”

Ah, I assumed it was a lake of water, but it must be some other type of liquid!




                                                       143
NPC Interaction
Lets make another NPC.
Name: 1d10 -> 12 -> “123” -> 8,3,3 -> “Lideler”
Personality: 6,7 -> Outgoing and Critical
Need / Motive: 5,0 -> Stability, Focus -> 7 -> Information

Rondini and the others glance up as they see their commander approaching them, his uniform dripping
with rain water. He has a slight frown on his face as he places his hand on the edge of the table.

Lideler: “Well, we may have a lead on that issue we have been tracking down. Another hunter has reported
seeing a scarred deer, seemingly completely healed from an injury. It is the third case in the last two
weeks, and all three cases have been spotted to the north, near the mines. We think it is possible that
someone, or something, is healing the animals. I want two of you to check it out.”

I need names for the coworkers…
NPC Name: 1d20 -> 4 -> “23-o” -> 5,8 -> “Barono”
NPC Name: 1d20 -> 15 -> “23-a” -> 19,0 -> “Sarkusa”
NPC Name: 1d20 -> 17 -> “23+” -> 11,18 -> “Rondice”, however this is too close to the PC so I’m going to
reroll: 1d20 -> 15 -> “23-a” -> 17,4 -> “Graniana”

NPC Dialog: 8,1 -> Action, Aggressive, Them

Barano: “Take one of them, I’m already busy dealing with those thefts from the other day”

NPC Dialog: 7,7 -> Denial, Aggressive, You

Sarkusa: “Ha, you sure look real busy, sitting there on your third ale…”

Barano shoots Sarkusa a sharp glance as Sarkusa smugly grins.

NPC Dialog: 1,1 -> Fact (Past), Neutral, Them

Graniana: “Lideler, you did assign Barano and Sarkusa jobs recently… Let Rondini and I handle this.” She
turns to Rondini. “Are you good with that?”

Rondini: “Yes” she nods with a slight sense of relief. “How about we head out first thing in the morning?”

Lideler: “Sounds good. Make sure to prepare properly, the mines are a trek away and we don’t know what
you will find inside.”

Graniana will be a sidekick. Lets flush her out a bit more.
Personality: 2d10 -> 9,0 -> “Confident, yet Sensitive”
Need: 1d10 @ Advantage -> 2 -> “Shelter”
Motive: 1d10 -> 8 -> “Equipment”



                                                        144
Color: 1d10 -> 8 -> “Metallic Silver”
Property x2 -> 1d10+1d6 -> 8,6,5,5 -> “Maximum Style, Major Quality”

Graniana has been with the force for a long time. She takes pride in her armor, which she has meticulously
handcrafted herself as a hobby. She integrates trinkets and keepsakes found during her adventures into
her armor, wearing them like girlscout badges. Graniana has always been kind to Rondini, standing up for
her when the others bullied her, and Rondini was put at ease knowing that she wasn’t paired up with
Barano for this mission.




                                                   145
Wilderness Exploration
Weather: 1d6@- +2 -> 4 -> “Thunder Storm”
From Kibble’s Weather Effects: Visibility is limited, travel pace is slowed to half speed, ranged weapon attacks
have a -2, and navigation checks are at disadvantage.
I’ll do the Wilderness Exploration procedure as normal, but the first roll of “0” will mean “Lost”.

The two step out of the barracks and pause under the awning. The air is dark and cold. Normally they can
hear the birds chirping through the crisp breeze as the sun peeks over the mountains in the distance, but
not today. Instead, they hear the sounds of the rain thumping on the roof, the water streaming down the
support pole and pooling at their feet, the mud squelching with each step. A flash of lightning briefly lights
up the area, reflecting off of Graniana’s shiny armor and highlighting the fur cloaks draped over each of
their shoulders.

“Aw man, why do we have to do this in the rain? This is miserable!” Graniana complains, as she takes her
first steps out into the open. Rondini follows behind at first, but then picks up the pace to walk at her side.
“Lideler said the mines were to the north about 6 miles. We normally could have made it in a couple of
hours, but with this weather slowing us down…” Rondini trails off as they approach the edge of the village.

They are headed out without a map or guide, just a vague idea of where the mines are, so they will be doing
straight rolls on the Encounter table. On the way back home, they will roll with Advantage since it will be easier
to find their way back.

Environment: 2dF -> “+ -“ -> “+0” -> “Arctic”
Type: 1dF -> “+” -> “Rocky Arctic”
Encounter: 1d10 -> 4 -> Challenge
Challenge: 5,9 -> “Intimidation, History”
DCs: 2d100 -> 38,90 -> “13, 10”

Not even an hour into the journey, the severity of the storm is rising. Rondini, drenched and covered in
mud, notices the shine of Graniana’s armor has been replaced with a dull matte of frost.

Rondini: “Graniana! This is too dangerous! We need to turn back before we freeze to death!”
Graniana, arm up to her face to shield her eyes from the relentless rain: “Oh come now, we can’t go back
empty handed, you know how Lideler gets! Besides, I think I remember there being some shelter near
here…”

In this scene, Graniana will be performing a History check to see if she can remember where the shelter is, while
Rondini will be doing an Intimidation (more like an aggressive persuasion) contest against Graniana’s Insight to
try and force her to turn back.

For this, we need Graniana’s D&D 5e stats for INT and WIS. I’ll give her +1 to INT and +2 to WIS, since she is a
veteran on the force. She likely has proficiency in Insight, but I’ll say she doesn’t have proficiency in History.

Rondini has a +4 to Intimidation, but she will be rolling at disadvantage due to Graniana out-ranking her.




                                                      146
For the context, I’ll use D&D 5e rules. Rondini rolls Intimidation as 1d20+4 at Disadvantage, vs Graniana’s
Insight as 1d20+4: 6 vs 7 -> Rondini’s Intimidation failed.
If this were a check between Rondini and the world / environment, I would roll Pay The Price to determine the
result. However, since this was a contest with a companion, I will instead roll on the Companion Response table,
with disadvantage to indicate that Graniana disapproves of Rondini’s request.

But before that, I want to do Graniana’s History Check, to gauge her confidence.
This time, since it is not a contest, I will be using the modified Ironsworn resolution for D&D 5e. That is, I roll
1d12+1 vs 2d20: 3+1 vs 7,13 -> She failed her History check.
Pay The Price: 1d10 -> 9 -> “Surprise Complication”

Graniana’s response:
1d100 -> 84 -> “Let’s Go!”

Rondini, grabbing Graniana’s shoulder and tugging back: “No, don’t be foolish, we can try again
tomorrow”
Graniana looks back and pulls her shoulder away: “No, YOU are being foolish! We know for a fact that
there are no shelters back where we came from, which means we are more likely to find safety by staying
the course. Now come on, we are wasting time and energy.”

I think it is obvious that the duo is now Lost, under the threat of freezing, with no shelter in sight. Still,
Graniana’s instinct is to keep moving forward, for she knows that if they just sit out here they are done for.

Being Lost means encounters are now rolled with a d6. This will extend the number of encounters before a result
of Destination can be reached.

Rondini reluctantly follows Graniana, but looks back over her shoulder. The storm cuts down on visibility,
and she cannot see the village in the distance. She isn’t even sure which direction it would be back there.
She snaps out of it as she realizes Graniana is right to press forward in search of shelter, and rejoins the
search with new determination.

Entering the next hex.
Environment: 2dF -> “+ 0” -> “+1” -> “Mountains”
Type: 1dF -> “+” -> “Expansive”
Encounter: 1d6 -> 1 -> “Natural Hazard” -> 1d6 -> 5 -> “Rockslide”

Fate Check: “Is there a cave nearby?” -> “< 0 6” -> “Yes, But… (Maximum) + Random Event”
Random Event: 1d10 -> 5 -> “Immersion”
Immersion: 5d10 -> 4,2,2,5,3 -> “You Hear Fire Behind and it causes Anger because it may be valuable”

I expect that this is some of Rondini’s and Grandiana’s friends searching for them, but it could also be
something like a group of Goblins.
Expectation Check: “- -“ -> “Opposite (Intensified)”

The two continue forward, pressing through the treacherous storm, but clearly losing stamina. Rondini’s
hands shiver as she does her best to position the heavy fur cloak across her chest. The muddy ground has
been getting more slippery, and for a while now there has been a mild incline as they approach the
mountains that seemed so far away just this morning. Graniana squints into the darkness, before pointing



                                                       147
and looking back at Rondini. “There! I think there is a cave!”

The team carefully approaches, but quickly enters just far enough to get out of the rain. Rondini
immediately begins wringing the water out of her muddy cloak, but Graniana is more focused on surveying
the cave itself, trying to assess if they are alone. “Get a torch ready” she instructs Rondini, as she tosses a
rock deeper into the cave, listening to the echo as it bounces along the ground.

They advance inward. The flickering light of the torch casts stalagtite-shaped shadows across the walls as
Graniana finally relaxes, removing her hand from the sword at her side. Turning to Rondini, she lets out a
sigh. “We should be safe here for now, as long as we stay near the exit. Lets get a campfire going and dry
off.”

Rondini drapes the soaked cloaks against the wall, hanging on some jagged rocks. The small campfire was
built offset to one side to dry the cloaks and provide enough room to walk around. Graniana squats near
the fire, first warming her hands before reaching for a ration. Her armor, while dry, doesn’t reflect the fire
light nearly as much as expected due to the mud smeared across it.

The two seize in fear as an intense roar is heard outside, one that drowns out even the furious thunder of
the storm. That sound could only be one thing: a dragon.

Rondini runs to the mouth of the cave, looking up to the sky to try and spot the source. Meanwhile,
Graniana instead turns inwards, observing the floor and wall for signs she missed during the first pass.
“Rondini! This is a dragon cave! We need to get out of here now!” she shouts, grabbing her pack and
cloak.

But Rondini doesn’t move. She stares at the sky in fear, watching as the dragon descends, an orange glow
growing in its throat. She is pulled backwards by Graniana, who yanks her into the cave and around the
wall to the side. The cave briefly lights up as the dragon lets out an intense flame, incinerating their
meager campfire. The dragon lands hard, grappling the rocks outside of the cave. The ground shakes, and
the opening collapses, sealing Rondini and Graniana in pitch black darkness.

This feels like a good time for a scene change.
I expect we will be exploring deeper into the cave to look for another way out.
Next Scene: 2dF -> “+ +” -> “Alter (Add)” -> 1d10 on the Focus table -> 1 -> Enemy
Seems they aren’t alone in here…

Side note: I had fully intended to do a bit more wilderness exploration before reaching our destination dungeon,
but it seems the oracle had other ideas. Instead, this cave will become the dungeon that I use to show the
dungeon exploration procedures.




                                                     148
Dungeon Exploration
Rondini clutches her chest, breathing fast and trying her best to fend off her panic as the unsettling sound
of the dragon’s claws scratch and scrape at the rubble. Graniana wastes no time fumbling with her pack to
retrieve her firestarter, and gets a torch lit. “Come on, we need to go!” she gestures deeper into the cave.

Side note: The dungeon generator is intended to help you draw a map as you explore. I will draw the map and
post an image at the end, but I am not going to be posting each individual step.

Next Area: 1d10@Dis -> 4 -> “Small Chamber, 2 Doors”
Condition: 1d6 -> 3 -> “Flooded”
Encounter: 1d10 -> 8 -> “Feature” -> 1d10 -> 1 -> “Library”

The two cautiously, but quickly, make their way towards the back of the cave. There, they discover that the
cave continues back, around a corner. The ground is wet, with various puddles forming, and a small trickle
of water bubbling gently along the wall coming from deeper in.

Rondini: “Rainwater from the storm? That must mean there is another exit deeper in, right?”
Graniana nods as she walks toward the source of the water, but glances up at the wall along the way.
“Look at these markings. Are they words? I can’t read them”.
The wall appears to have symbolic engravings carved into the stone. Not pictures, more like a pattern with
structure. Neither soldier had seen a language resembling it before.

Next Area: 1d10@Dis -> 6 -> “Locked Door”

On the other side of this room was another pile of debris blocking the path. Torchlight illuminated the
ground on the other side through holes in the rubble as the duo peered through.

Rondini: “Hey! There is more cave on the other side! If we can get through, I don’t think that dragon will be
able to fit!”
Graniana: “Help me move these rocks. We only need enough space to squeeze in.”
Graniana sets down her pack and begins moving the rocks. Rondini helps.

Here, we will do an Athletics check, using the PC’s stats but with Advantage since they have help. Doing it
Ironsworn-style, so 2d12+5 vs 2d20: [5,7]+5 vs [2,16]. 13 vs [2,16] is a Weak Hit / Partial Success.

Just as they get one of the larger stones out of the way, they hear a deep screech coming from the
entrance to the cave. The dragon had finally gotten in! Rondini pulls Graniana in through the hole, though
Graniana’s pack gets left behind as the two scurry deeper in.

Next Area: 1d10@Dis -> 0 (Doubles!) -> Passage
Passage: 1d10 -> 6 -> “Expected”
Encounter: 1d10 -> 7 -> “Trap”

Since I rolled doubles, I will be rolling the Next Area with Advantage from now on.



                                                      149
Also, I never declared that either character was spending time searching for traps (they have been in quite the
hurry).

Rondini’s Passive Perception is 12 (+2), and Graniana’s is 14 (+4). Lets roll the DC for detecting the trap: 1d100
-> 11 -> DC 15. (I arbitrarily chose to use the normal D&D 5e-style check instead of the Ironsworn-style check
since it was passive and not active.) They both fail to spot the trap, so it is triggered. Note that if either of them
had spotted it, they wouldn’t auto-trigger it, but would need to find a way to disarm or bypass it to continue
forward.

Now that we know the trap is triggered, lets see what kind of trap it is.
Trap: 2d10 -> 0,5 -> “Trigger Fall”

The two hurry down the passage, which is much narrower than the previous sections; they don’t think the
dragon will be able to follow. As they run, Rondini slips on a wet rock and falls to the ground, which
crumbles beneath here as the floor of the cave collapses down!

Rondini Dexterity Save: 1d12-1 vs 2d20 -> 7 vs [14, 19] (Miss)
Graniana Dexterity Save: 1d12-1 vs 2d20 -> 9 vs [11, 13] (Miss)

Rondini tries to catch the edge but her hand slips due to the slick moss covering the rocks. Graniana turns
and reaches out her hand to catch, but is too late. Rondini falls into a pit.

HP: 12 minus one hit die (1d10) -> 12 - 9 -> 3

Graniana: “Rondini! Are you ok!? Can you hear me!?”
Rondini: “Ugh, ouch… Yea, I’m alive, but that wrecked my leg…”
Graniana: “Hang on, I’ll get you out!”

The problem here is that Graniana had to leave her pack behind; Rondini has the supplies down in the pit with
her.

Fate Check: “Does Rondini have a rope?” -> “+ - 1” -> “Yes, But… (Minimal)”

Rondini: “I have a rope in my pack, but I don’t know if I can get it up to you… Wait, I might have an idea!”

Her character sheet says she has a javelin and can throw it 30 feet. It should be more than enough to tie the
rope to it and throw it up. Though since I said her leg was injured, I would use her Second Wind ability to heal
the damage, allowing her to stand. This is an example where instead of rolling on Pay The Price for failing the
trap checks, the consequence for failing was resource usage.

Graniana catches the javelin and pulls Rondini up. “Whew, that was a bit of a tough spot. We need to be
more careful!”

Collecting themselves, they continue following the passage, this time more cautiously.

Now that they know the cave is more dangerous than it first appears, they will spend some time in each area
looking for traps.




                                                        150
Next Area: 1d10@Adv -> 8 -> “Exit”
Encounter: 1d10 -> 0 -> “Treasure”
Treasure: 4d6 -> 6,3,2,4 -> “Armor: Tattered Leather Gloves”

The passage continued a short way, before opening up to another chamber. The sound of the rain and
thunder had been getting louder, and now the pair learned why; a hole in the ceiling was letting the rain
water in. It trickled down the side of the wall and along the floor back to where they came from.

The hole was high, but narrow enough that they didn’t need to worry about the dragon. At the bottom of
the hole, half buried in the mud, were the bones of a skeleton. It appeared as if someone had fallen into
the hole long ago. Many of the bones were broken, some with torn cloth wrapped around them, as if the
person had tried making a tourniquet. A pair of tattered gloves lay next to a worn pack full of holes
chewed by animals.

Fate Check: “Anything useful in the pack? (Unlikely)” -> “No (Moderate)”.

Rondini and Graniana look at each other, then up at the hole. “Well, now what?”




                                                     151

Conclusion
Through that example, I hit almost every table in Juice at least once. I actually fudged way less rolls than I
thought I was going to have to, I tried my best to work with the rolls I got so it didn’t seem too forced, and
I am pleasantly surprised with how it went. I had a pretty clear cut goal in mind, but things happened, the
direction changed, and I just went along for the ride.

And that is how solo roleplaying should go; Have a vague idea of what you want to do, don’t get hung up
on the details, just start rolling and get lost in the story. Tackle things as they pop up, let the dice throw
curve balls, and you will be surprised at how much you can surprise yourself!




                                                     153
Random
Now, I will walk through a completely random example.

This time, I’m not going to follow the above template. That is, I won’t be starting in a settlement looking for
a quest. I also won’t be starting with any specific goal in mind. And I won’t be fudging any rolls.

Frequently, I see posts on Reddit of people asking how they can get started, and I want to show you that
you don’t really need any prerequisites; just start rolling and see where it takes you.

Additionally, I won’t be using any system; I want to prove that Juice can really be used standalone to have a
great solo roleplaying session.

So lets dive in!

—

Name: 1d20 -> 20 -> “123+” -> 5,10,10 -> Upenosa

Upenosa slowly opens her eyes to a blaring alarm, her vision blurry and head woozy. There is an iron taste
in her mouth as blood slides down her face, dripping down into her lap. She fumbles with her harness as
smoke fills the cabin.

Her ship is small, designed for quick hops between stations, not for falling from orbit. Luckily, all ships in
this class are required to have parachutes for emergency reentry.

Upenosa pulls the release lever in a jarring motion, ejecting the hatch above her with a pressurized force
that sucks the smoke out with it. She wipes her forehead and climbs up the ladder, squinting as her eyes
adjust to the light.

Type/Environment -> 1d10 + 1dF -> [0, -] -> “Sandy Desert”
Weather -> 1d6@Adv +4 -> 7 -> “Heavy Clouds”

Upenosa stands atop the crashed ship, nose half buried in the sand. Her heart sinks as she stares out
across miles of rolling sand dunes, not a sign of civilization in any direction. The rear of the ship has now
caught fire, with thick black smoke billowing up into the air. She slides down the side of the ship and her
boots sink softly into the dry sand.

Pieces of scrap metal sparkle in the sand around the site. The parachute ripples in the breeze, tugging on
the cords, but the ship itself doesn’t budge. Unzipping the top half of her suit is difficult due to her shaky
hands from the adrenaline. As it falls down to her waist, she checks her torso for any undiscovered injuries,
the sweat from her arms evaporating in the desert heat. Surprisingly intact.

Next up is an inventory check, and a momentary panic overcomes her as she runs towards the side of the
burning ship. Each vessel is equipped with an emergency kit for this very reason, and she had to retrieve it
before the fire consumed it.


                                                     154
Fate Check: “Is she able to retrieve an undamaged emergency kit?” -> “Yes But (Minor)”

She reaches for the handle to open the storage panel, but the metal is too hot. Reaching down, she grabs
the sleeve of her suit hanging from her waist and wraps it around her hand a few times. A quick tug
releases the panel, exposing the red kit, it’s plastic coating slightly warped by the heat. She retreats back
from the ship and drops to the ground, analyzing the contents.

Inside, her eyes immediately fixate on the laser pistol. She had seen one many times; they were commonly
carried by guards at the stations. However, she had never actually held one, and was a bit hesitant to pick
it up. Continuing to the right, there were items embedded into foam pockets of the case: A quad scanner,
a fixed blade knife, a metal cylinder, a large pack of individually wrapped food rations, and a few other
miscellaneous items packaged in a small bag.

Collecting the items, she cuts some cordage and material from the parachute, then picks a direction and
starts walking.

Alright, I have set the scene, dropped my character into a completely blank world, and defined a basic inventory.
Realistically, in this situation it might make most sense to just stay put; the smoke from the ship will be a pretty
clear signal to anyone in the area, and she can at least scavenge the site to build a makeshift shelter. However,
as a player, I want to explore, so off we go.

Next Scene: 2dF -> “- 0” -> “Normal”
Encounter: 1d6 (We are lost) -> 1 -> “Natural Hazard” -> 1d10 -> 1 -> “Creature Tracks”
Monster: “1d6@Adv + 4” -> 8 -> “Zombie”

Upenosa presses on, her legs strained from walking in the sand. The air is hot and dry, but the clouds
have been keeping the direct sunlight from scorching her skin. Distracted by the screen of the quad
scanner, she stumbles as her foot bumps against something.

Draped across her boot is a sand covered entrail. “Ew ew ew!” she squeals, jumping back, before slowly
squatting down to investigate. The meat is rotted and slightly green, with an atrocious odor. She swings
her head around to the left and right, scanning the area.

Immersion Check: 8,0,9,5,-,7 -> “You smell soil on the ground and it causes anger because then it is suddenly
gone”

With a closer look, there were bits of rotted flesh covered in sand speckled all around. The smell was faint,
periodically cleared by the breeze. To Upenosa, it appeared that something was killed here, and she didn’t
want to stick around to meet the killer.

Fate Check: “Is there anything else here?” -> “+ + 6” -> “Yes And (Maximum)”
Fate Check: “A dangerous creature?” -> “+ + 1” -> “Yes And (Minimal)”

But as she took the next step, some piles of sand began to shake around her. A skeletal hand rises out of
one, bits of flesh dripping off into the sand. Then, another, and a third, as decayed bodies crawl out of the
ground emitting a groaning sound. They limp toward her.

Upenosa draws the laser pistol, shakily aiming it towards one of the beings, closes her eyes and pulls the


                                                       155
trigger. A high pitched sound fills the air as the bone of an arm is severed, dropping to the ground.
However, the creature itself appears unaffected as it continues its advance.

She aims again, this time taking a deep breath and bringing her offhand up to stabilize the shaky weapon.
She aligns the creature’s leg between the sights, and pulls the trigger.

Fate Check: “Does this defeat the zombie?” -> “+ + “ -> “Yes And (Major)” (3 Yes Ands in a row!?)

The monstrosity drops to the ground, unable to balance on a single leg. Its unnerving groan continues
unfazed as it attempts to crawl forward with its remaining arm, but it only manages to pull loose sand
toward itself.

Upenosa spins, aiming for the leg of another. The creatures are thankfully slow, and she is able to drop
each of them to the ground with a few shots. She lowers the weapon, taking a moment to observe the
creatures struggle in the sand as her rapid breathing is brought back under control. Satisfied, she turns
away from the pillar of black smoke in the far distance and continues forward, this time with the quad
scanner stowed in her pocket.

Next Scene: 2dF -> “0 +” -> “Normal”
Environment: 2dF -> “+ +” -> (Desert +2 is still Desert)
Type: 1dF -> “-“ -> “Sandy”
Encounter: 1d6 (Still Lost) -> 1 -> “Natural Hazard” -> 1d10 -> 3 -> “Flood”

The horizon over the sand fluctuates in the heat. Upenosa has lost track of time, and around her in each
direction is nothing but sand dunes. Glancing over her shoulder, she can no longer see the pillar of smoke.

As she crests another of the countless mounds of sand, she pauses, blinking and trying to comprehend
what lie in front of her. Shimmering at the bottom of the hill is… an oasis? The lake beckons her, its crystal
waters rippling gently in the breeze.

No, this must be a trick of the mind. Her cylinder of water had run empty long ago, and her body is giving
out. Still, there is hope that it is real, right? The hope drives her forward, half sliding down the sand
towards the blue. The most beautiful blue she had ever seen.

Approaching the edge of the lake, she reaches down, dipping a hand in. It is surprisingly cool. She brings
her other hand down to scoop some up, but pauses and instead retrieves the quad scanner.

Fate Check: “Is this water safe to drink?” -> “+ - 5” -> “Yes But (Major)”
I’m not sure what the “But” here could be…
Discover Meaning: 2d20 -> 18,9 -> “Peaceful Shadow”

The quad scanner’s familiar low pitched tone prompts Upenosa to raise a cupful of water to her lips. A
wave of refreshment washes over her as she drinks the liquid. After splashing some onto her face, she
retrieves the metal cylinder and dips it into the lake.

“Who are you?”

The hairs on her neck stand on end as she whips toward the sound. In the shadow of the dune she



                                                       156
descended sits a figure draped in light brown cloths, with an arm resting on one knee in the air.

Ok realistically, Upenosa wouldn’t be able to understand whatever language this person speaks. However, for the
sake of gaming, I am just going to handwave that away. I enjoy conversing and interacting with NPCs, and I
don’t want to deal with the language barrier.

She takes a step backwards, exclaiming “Who am I? Who are YOU!?”
She was so startled it didn’t even cross her mind to ready her weapon.

NPC Dialog: 2d10 -> “6,6” -> “End Conversation”

The figure tilts their head, then stands up without responding.

I expect that they will approach Upenosa, but they could also turn to some sort of hideout and gesture her to
follow.

Expectation Check: 2dF -> “0 -“ -> “Unfavorable”

Ok, I guess that means they will either brandish a weapon or sound an alarm.

Expectation Check: 2dF -> “0 +” -> “Favorable”

The figure slides his foot across the sand, eyes locked on Upenosa. He presses down in a specific spot,
and the sound of a bell begins ringing. In an instant, shutters hidden in the sides of the surrounding dunes
pop open with a small cloud of dust. Multiple figures poke out, bows aimed at Upenosa. An underground
structure in the sand?

The figure approaches: “You are coming with us”

Next Scene: 2dF -> “0 0” -> “Normal”

Upenosa is kicked to the floor, landing on her knees. She looks around, hands tied behind her back. The
room is large, with walls composed of rusted metal, lit by yellow glowing stones. A loosely organized ring
of about 20 soldiers surround her, though they have distanced themselves far back. Only the two behind
her have weapons displayed.

A tall man with a tattered cloak draped over his shoulders steps forward, hands folded behind his back.

Man, in a stern voice: “Where is the rest of your team?”

Upenosa: “Team? I.. I’m alone”

NPC Dialog: 2d10 -> 7,3 -> “Action, Aggressive, Me”
Simple Name: 3d20 on column 1 -> 3,19,20 -> Itato

Man, frowning: “You dare lie to me? No one can survive the desert alone. Not with the Itato.”

Upenosa: “Itato?”



                                                      157
Man: “The dead that refuses to die. Where did you come from?”

Upenosa pauses before responding: “The sky”

A few of the other people in the background turn to each other in whispers.

NPC Dialog: 2d10 -> 8,7 -> “Denial, Aggressive, You”
Fate Check: “Have they found the wreckage?” -> “0 + 1” -> “Favorable (Minimal)”
I think it would be most favorable if they have, since that would put some truth behind Upenosa’s words.

Man, squinting: “Such a thing cannot be.” He places his fingers on his forehead, “Yet, your presence here
has no other explanation…”

He gestures towards your items sitting on the nearby table.

Man: “These things are not known to us. And your arrival here after the mysterious black fire in the east…”
He squats down in front of Upenosa, studying her and her dusty suit. “Perhaps the sky truly did spit you
out.”

He stands and turns his back to her, raising his arm and flicking his hand. A soldier behind her slices the
ropes typing her hands.

Man: “You are free to go. We will be keeping your things.” He turns his head back to Upenosa. “Cause any
problems and you will be stripped and thrown out to the Itato.”

Upenosa: “I.. What?”

Man: “You are one of us, at least for the time being. Take the evening to recover. Tomorrow your work
begins.”

He turns to a soldier to his right: “Show her to the sleeping quarters, and provide her a meal.”

The soldier nods, approaches Upenosa, and extends down his hand.

Alright, now we have a safe place, some NPCs to talk to, and a good way to spin off some quests. For the next
scene, I will use the Dungeon Generator’s “Next Area / Passage” tables to map out this base, then assign rooms
by interpreting rolls on the Settlement Establishment tables.

We also have the start of our worldbuilding. This is a vast desert, and we are so deep into it that it is
inconceivable for someone to simply wander out this far alone. It isn’t even clear yet if there are other biomes.
There is an active threat of the Itato, a zombie-like monster that is prevalent in the desert. And there is a small,
close knit group of survivors hiding in underground structures. They are humanoid like us, yet clearly they see us
as alien or foreign to their world. Still, to accept Upenosa so quickly, I wonder why…

I can use the “Extended NPC Conversation Tables” and Fate Checks to further flush out the details of this world,
as my character will likely be asking NPCs a lot of questions. And for the scene after that, I will generate a quest
that Upenosa will be brought on.



                                                       158
In other words, the story has approached a point where we are essentially in a settlement with NPCs, where
quests will spawn off that push the character out into the world. It mirrors the adventure template we discussed
earlier.

For that reason, I think this is a decent spot to stop the example. But hopefully, you can see how easy it is to
start from nothing and just roll the dice to see what happens. And Juice is here to help you along the way.

Use of AI
Was AI used in the making of Juice?

Well, yes and no. Technically, AI was used at some points during the process, but not for the types of
things this question is usually asking about.

First, this entire document was written by hand - no AI generation. Second, every word on every table in
Juice was hand selected.

So how was AI used? I frequently use AI for brainstorming and checking my tables for balance, poking
holes in the procedures, etc. Basically as a rubber duck I can bounce ideas off of. For example, AI helped
me find flaws with the Dungeon and Wilderness exploration procedures, which led me to changing how it
works or rearranging some of the table entries.

In other words, I use AI for the design aspect, but not the final product.

For the tables, in many cases my process is this:

1) Combine a bunch of wordlists from various sources, such as Mythic or Ironsworn
2) Use a variety of techniques to filter and sort the wordlists
3) Expand the lists using synonyms and antonyms via Wordnet
4) Use a local LLM embedding model to convert words to vectors, then cluster them
5) Use a variety of heuristics to select a single word from each cluster
6) Use diversity filtering to narrow down the list to the top 50

After that, sometimes I use AI to read my list of 50 and add other candidates to the list. Sometimes I give
AI two words and ask it to find a word that exists “between” them, things that I can’t normally get from a
Thesaurus. Afterwards, I rerun the pipeline to get back down to 50. And from the list of 50, I hand select
my favorites to make a table.

You see, the main problem with AI is that it is not deterministic; if I were to use AI to make any tables, it
would generate completely different tables each time. There would be no way to judge which is best. I
don’t like that. Using it as an embedding model with standard NLP techniques retains the determinism, and
helps me iteratively create better lists.

Not every table is made this way; some come from very specific sources (like NPC Personality coming from
the OCEAN method), some come from other content creators (which I credit!), and some I just populate
myself without the above pipeline (like the Dungeon Passage table for example).

By the way, my code is here: https://github.com/jrruethe/wordlist_filter
