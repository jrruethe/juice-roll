|-------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | You must be joking if you think I'll do that. |
| 3-4 | I refuse to go along with that plan. |
| 5-6 | That would never work because... There must be a better way. |
| 7-8 | No way, that's too... |
| 9-10 | What benefit could... possible bring us? |
| 11-12 | I'm not comfortable with that idea. |
| 13-14 | We need to spend more time here doing... |
| 15-16 | Don't you think there's the risk of...? |
| 17-18 | Do we have enough... to do that? |
| 19-20 | It's one option, but I would prefer to... |

| 43-44 | What if we take a completely unexpected route to get to...? |
| 45-46 | I've got a wild plan that just might work... |
| 47-48 | Yes, but how about we surprise them with... |
| 49-50 | We can do that, but we have to tone down the... |
| 51-52 | Who would that benefit? |
| 53-54 | What is the next step? |
| 55-56 | When should we...? |
| 57-58 | Where should we...? |
